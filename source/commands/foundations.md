name: foundations
description: Generate a coherent design system foundation — design tokens (typography, color, spacing, motion, radius, elevation) plus 3-5 essential component primitives — calibrated to the project's context. Produces both working code (CSS variables, token files, component implementations) and documentation explaining the system's reasoning. Operates autonomously from context with minimal interaction; asks one or two critical questions only if context is thin. Use when establishing a new design system or rebuilding an existing system from the foundations.

# /foundations

The design system generation command. Where `/design` produces a single artifact and `/remix` produces three variants of one thing, `/foundations` produces the underlying system that everything else gets built on top of — the tokens, the primitives, the governing decisions that make a design system coherent.

A design system is the cheapest and most durable investment in product design. The decisions made once at the system level cascade through every component, every page, every future feature. Get the foundations right and the work that follows inherits coherence. Get them wrong and every subsequent design choice fights the system. `/foundations` exists to establish the foundations deliberately rather than letting them accumulate by default.

This command produces both working code and documentation. The code is implementable — CSS variables, token files, component implementations ready to integrate. The documentation explains the reasoning, so the team using the system understands what it's trying to be and can extend it coherently.

---

## When to Use This Command

Use `/foundations` when:

- Starting a new project and establishing the design system before building features.
- An existing project's foundations are incoherent (tokens scattered or inconsistent, no clear character) and need to be rebuilt systematically.
- A team is ready to formalize a design system after organic growth has produced inconsistency.
- The context has shifted enough (rebrand, major pivot, new audience) that the foundations should be reconsidered.

Do not use `/foundations` when:

- The project already has strong foundations and only specific corrections are needed (use targeted corrective commands).
- The user wants to build or fix specific components rather than the underlying system (use `/design` or `/refine`).
- The user wants to explore directions before committing (use `/remix` to see alternatives first, then `/foundations` once a direction is chosen).
- The scope is small enough that system-level work is overkill (use `/design` for single components or pages).

---

## What /foundations Produces

The output has two parallel parts: the working code and the documentation. Both are delivered together so the team has what it needs to both implement and understand the system.

### Design tokens

The system's atoms. Every subsequent design decision references these rather than inventing values:

**Typography tokens.** Typeface selection (display and body), complete type scale with named tokens, weight system, line-height tokens for different size ranges, letter-spacing tokens where needed.

**Color tokens.** Neutral palette (backgrounds, surfaces, text levels, borders), accent color(s), semantic colors (success, warning, error, info), interactive state modifications. Both light-mode and dark-mode if the product supports both. Values in OKLCH where practical.

**Spacing tokens.** Complete spacing scale (typically 4px-based) with named tokens covering intimate through architectural spacing. Responsive scaling approach if relevant.

**Radius tokens.** The system's approach to corner radius — typically two or three named values.

**Elevation tokens.** The system's approach to depth — shadow values, border-based elevation, or flat-plus-space approach. Dark mode elevation if applicable.

**Motion tokens.** Duration tokens (instant, fast, base, slow, slower) and easing tokens (ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, plus any system-specific curves).

### Core component primitives

Three to five of the most essential components implemented as the foundation other components will extend. Which specific three to five depends on the product type:

- **For applications:** typically Button, Input, Card, plus one or two of Select, Modal, Navigation item.
- **For marketing sites:** typically Button, Link, Heading, plus one or two of Card, Section, Container.
- **For data-heavy products:** typically Button, Input, Table row, plus one or two of Badge, Tooltip, DataValue.

The choice of which primitives to include depends on the product — pick the ones that will be used most and whose treatment most defines the system's character.

### Documentation

A brief system guide explaining:

- **The character.** What the system is trying to be. One paragraph.
- **The key decisions.** A short list of the defining choices — typeface direction, palette approach, density, radius system, elevation approach, motion character, voice register.
- **How to extend.** Guidance for future components that will be built on top — what to reference from the tokens, what patterns to follow, what to avoid.
- **What's not included.** Explicit scope notes — this system covers the core foundations and these five primitives; other components will extend this foundation but weren't part of this pass.

The documentation should be short and specific — a page or two at most. It's a guide, not a manual.

---

## The Work Process

### 1. Read the context

Read the `.spruce.md` context file. `/foundations` depends heavily on context — the system's character, density, voice register, and accent approach all flow from what the product is trying to be.

If the context file is rich, proceed directly. If it's missing or thin, identify the critical gaps and ask one or two targeted questions before generating. Do not launch into a long discovery — the goal is to fill the specific gaps that would make autonomous generation unreliable.

The critical questions are typically:

- What is the product, and who uses it? (Without this, the system can't have character.)
- What's the overall density direction — spacious, balanced, or dense? (Without this, the system can't calibrate tokens.)

Ask no more than two questions. If more is needed, suggest running `/spruce init` first to establish full context.

### 2. Establish the system's character

Before generating tokens, name the character the system will express. This is the decision that governs everything else. Examples:

- "Restrained and editorial — a premium content-first product for thoughtful readers."
- "Technical and precise — a developer tool for senior professionals who value directness."
- "Warm and approachable — a consumer wellness product for busy parents."

The character is not a slogan. It's the design direction that specific token choices will express.

### 3. Make the system-level decisions

Before tokens, decide the system-level directions:

- **Typography direction.** Serif, sans, mono, pairing approach. Specific typefaces.
- **Color direction.** Warm or cool temperature, neutral tinting approach, accent strategy.
- **Density direction.** Spacious, balanced, or dense. Affects spacing scale and component proportions.
- **Radius approach.** Sharp, moderate, or heavily rounded; consistent or two-level.
- **Elevation approach.** Shadows, borders, or flat-plus-space.
- **Motion character.** Crisp, considered, or expressive. Affects duration and easing defaults.
- **Voice register.** Formal to casual, warm to neutral, direct to gentle.

These decisions cascade into specific token values. Make them explicitly so the token generation is coherent rather than arbitrary.

### 4. Apply the anti-attractor check

For `/foundations` specifically, this matters. The system's defaults will shape every future component — avoiding AI-default directions at this level prevents generic outputs from cascading through the product.

Specifically check against:

- Inter, Roboto, or system-ui as the typography default without deliberate reason.
- Purple-gradient or tech-blue as the accent default without deliberate reason.
- 8-12px radius on everything without character justification.
- Subtle drop-shadow elevation as the default.
- The "friendly-professional SaaS" voice default.
- Three-equal-columns as the layout default for component layouts.

The character decision should have already directed away from these; the anti-attractor check is a final gate.

### 5. Generate the tokens

Produce the complete token set as working code. Use the project's conventions when discernible (CSS variables, Tailwind config, design tokens JSON, etc.); when conventions aren't clear, default to CSS custom properties with clear naming.

Token naming should be semantic where possible (`color-text-primary` rather than `color-neutral-900`) to encode the design intent into the code.

### 6. Generate the primitive components

Build the 3-5 core components using the tokens. Every value in the components references a token — no magic numbers, no inline colors, no one-off spacing.

Include all states for interactive primitives: default, hover, active, focus, disabled, loading where applicable. State treatments reference the token system.

### 7. Generate the documentation

Write the brief system guide. Keep it short and specific. Focus on the reasoning, not on explaining what tokens do (the token names should do that work themselves).

---

## Output Format

The output has three clearly-separated parts:

### 1. System overview

A brief section at the top explaining what's being produced:

> # Design System Foundation
>
> A design system foundation calibrated to [product description from context]. The character is [one-sentence character statement].
>
> Key decisions: [four to six short bullets on the defining choices — typeface, palette, density, radius, elevation, voice register].
>
> What follows: design tokens, core component primitives ([list the 3-5 components]), and a brief system guide.

### 2. Design tokens

All tokens delivered as working code. Organize by domain (typography, color, spacing, radius, elevation, motion) with clear section headers. Include comments explaining non-obvious choices briefly — not exhaustive documentation, just enough for a developer reading the file to understand intent.

### 3. Component primitives

Each primitive as working code. Include a brief comment above each explaining its role in the system and what variants/states are covered.

### 4. System guide

The brief documentation explaining the character, key decisions, how to extend, and what's not included.

### 5. Closing

Two or three lines pointing to next steps:

> **Next steps:** This foundation covers the system's atoms and five essential components. Build additional components on top by referencing these tokens. Run `/design` to generate new pages or components using this foundation, or `/remix` if you want to see alternative directions before committing.

---

## What Not to Do

**Don't produce a complete design system in one pass.** The scope is foundations plus 3-5 primitives, not every component the product will need. Scope creep is the enemy.

**Don't produce tokens without a character.** The character decision comes before the tokens. Without it, tokens are arbitrary values rather than coherent system choices.

**Don't pick defaults that undermine the character.** If the character is "technical and precise," the typography shouldn't be Inter, the corners shouldn't be 8px, the voice shouldn't be "friendly-professional." Character commits to specific directions.

**Don't over-document.** The system guide is a short orientation, not a manual. A few paragraphs, not pages.

**Don't ask more than one or two questions.** If context is so thin that more questions would be needed, recommend `/spruce init` first rather than turning `/foundations` into a questionnaire.

**Don't produce tokens that fight themselves.** Every token should work with every other token. If the color palette is warm, the accent shouldn't be cool without deliberate reason. If the density is dense, the spacing scale shouldn't include excessive architectural values that won't get used.

**Don't treat the output as final.** The foundation is a starting point that will evolve. The documentation should acknowledge this — what's here is the considered starting position, refinement is expected as the system gets built on.

---

## Tone

- **Confident.** System-level decisions require commitment. Don't hedge on the character or the directions.
- **Clear in reasoning.** The system guide should make the intent legible to future readers who weren't in the conversation when it was generated.
- **Specific.** Named typefaces, specific OKLCH values, concrete scale numbers. The system is useful because it's specific.

---

## Edge Cases

**When the context file is rich and complete.** Proceed directly. The foundation should flow from context with minimal friction.

**When the context file is absent.** Ask the two critical questions (what is the product, who uses it; and what's the density direction), then proceed. Don't try to generate a foundation from no context at all.

**When the existing project has partial foundations.** If tokens exist but are incomplete, treat the existing values as signals of direction rather than replacing them wholesale. Extend and fill gaps rather than rebuilding. Note the existing values you're preserving and which you're augmenting.

**When the context is contradictory.** If the context file says one thing but the user's recent direction suggests another, surface the contradiction before generating: "Your context file describes the product as restrained and premium, but you've described the current feature as bold and expressive. The foundation I'd build for the first would be different from the second. Which direction should the system express?"

**When the user wants a specific component not on the typical 3-5 list.** Accept the redirection. If they've asked for Button, Table row, and Badge as the three primitives, build those. The 3-5 default list is guidance, not a rule.

**When dark mode support is ambiguous.** If the context doesn't mention dark mode but the product is a web application, ask: "Should the foundation include dark mode, or light mode only?" Dark mode doubles the color token work and should be a deliberate scope decision.

## Example Interaction (Abbreviated)

**User:** `/foundations`

**Spruce:**

# Design System Foundation

A design system foundation calibrated to a precision-oriented analytics platform for senior marketers. The character is technical, restrained, and respectful of expert users — the system expresses density and precision without feeling cold, and directness without condescension.

**Key decisions:**
- Typography: IBM Plex Sans for body and interface, IBM Plex Mono for data and technical elements — signals technical professionalism without defaulting to Inter.
- Color: Cool neutral palette (tinted toward blue undertones) with a deep emerald accent — avoids tech-blue default while staying restrained.
- Density: Balanced leaning dense — the audience is expert, spaciousness would waste their time.
- Radius: Minimal rounding (2px) for interface components; pill shape for badges only. Sharp corners signal precision.
- Elevation: Border-based for structural separation, minimal shadow. Flat-plus-space as the primary hierarchy tool.
- Motion: Fast and crisp (100-200ms for most transitions) with ease-out for arrivals. Expert users value responsiveness.
- Voice: Direct and specific, assumes expertise, no friendly-professional warmth.

What follows: design tokens across all domains, five core component primitives (Button, Input, Table Row, Badge, Card), and a brief system guide.

## Component Primitives

## System Guide

**The character.** This system expresses precision and technical professionalism. Every decision — the sharp 2px corners, the cool-tinted neutrals, the deep emerald accent that avoids the tech-blue default, the fast crisp motion, the direct voice — is made to signal "this is a tool for experts." Restraint is the primary aesthetic signal.

**How to extend.** New components should reference the existing tokens rather than inventing values. When a new token is needed, add it to the system and document why. Follow the established patterns: minimal radius, border-based elevation, state treatments with consistent timing. The type scale is deliberately restrained (three weights) — resist the temptation to add more.

**What's not included.** This foundation covers design tokens and five primitives (Button, Input, Table Row, Badge, Card). Additional components — navigation, modals, forms, data visualizations, and application-specific patterns — will be built on top of this foundation as they're needed. Those components should follow the character and token patterns established here.

---

**Next steps:** This foundation covers the system's atoms and five essential components. Build additional components on top by referencing these tokens. Run `/design` to generate new pages or components using this foundation, or `/remix` if you want to see alternative foundation directions before committing.

---

*This command is part of Spruce. `/foundations` establishes the design system atoms and core primitives in one pass — tokens plus 3-5 essential components plus a brief system guide — calibrated to the product's context and ready to build on.*
