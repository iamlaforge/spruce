name: remix
description: Generate three genuinely distinct design directions for the same brief. Each variant commits to a fundamentally different aesthetic or approach — not minor variations on a theme. Each is labeled briefly (e.g., "Editorial", "Technical", "Warm") so the user can see the direction at a glance. Use when you want to see real alternatives before committing to a direction, rather than receiving a single answer from /design.

# /remix

The variant-generation command. Where `/design` produces one considered answer and `/decide` walks the user through decisions before generating, `/remix` produces three genuinely distinct directions for the same brief — so the user can see real alternatives side by side before committing to one.

This command exists because most design decisions have multiple legitimate answers, and seeing the alternatives often clarifies preference faster than discussing them in the abstract. A developer tool could be austere and technical, or warm and approachable, or expressive and distinctive — all three are defensible, and seeing them executed makes the choice concrete.

`/remix` always produces three variants. Not two (too binary), not five (too scattered). Three is the sweet spot for distinctiveness without overwhelming.

---

## When to Use This Command

Use `/remix` when:

- The user wants to see alternatives before committing to a direction.
- The brief has multiple legitimate answers and the right one isn't obvious from context.
- The user has an existing design but wants to see what else is possible.
- The user is exploring direction early in a project.
- The user says "show me options," "what else could this look like," or similar exploration-framed requests.

Do not use `/remix` when:

- The user has given clear direction and wants it executed (use `/design`).
- The user wants to be walked through decisions one at a time (use `/decide`).
- The task is small enough that variants would be excessive (a single button component probably doesn't need three directions).
- The user wants existing work improved rather than reconsidered (use corrective commands).
- The context is so specific that three directions would all converge on the same answer.

---

## Scope Handling

`/remix` accepts an optional scope argument to focus the variants:

- `/remix` — three directions for the most recent design output, or the current work in scope.
- `/remix [what to remix]` — three directions for a specific component, page, or feature. Examples: `/remix hero section`, `/remix pricing page`, `/remix onboarding flow`.
- `/remix [domain]` — three directions focused on a specific aspect. Examples: `/remix typography`, `/remix color`, `/remix layout`. Use this when the rest of the design is locked and only one axis is being explored.

When scope is ambiguous, ask one clarifying question before generating. Don't produce three directions for the wrong thing.

## What "Distinct Direction" Means

The variants must be genuinely different, not minor variations. The test: if someone saw the three variants without context, would they see three different products rather than three versions of the same product?

Distinctness operates at the level of aesthetic commitment and character, not surface decoration. Three variants that all use the same typography with different accent colors are not distinct directions — they're variations on a theme. Three variants that commit to different typographic voices (a restrained modern serif, a technical monospace, a humanist sans) are distinct directions.

### How variants differ

For most briefs, distinctness comes from different commitments across several layers:

- **Character register.** Restrained vs. expressive, serious vs. playful, classical vs. contemporary, technical vs. humanist.
- **Visual weight.** Dense and structured vs. spacious and editorial vs. bold and graphic.
- **Typographic direction.** Different typeface families expressing different voices.
- **Color approach.** Different temperatures, different accent strategies, different palette architectures.
- **Layout archetype.** Different structural approaches when the brief allows.
- **Motion character.** Different tempo and easing character when motion is part of the output.
- **Voice.** Different copy register when UX writing is involved.

Not every variant needs to differ on every layer. But across the three variants, multiple layers should differ meaningfully. If only one layer differs (three variants with the same typography, color, layout, and motion, but different button radii), the command has failed its purpose.

### How to keep them anchored

Distinct doesn't mean arbitrary. Each variant should still serve the product's context and purpose — they're three different good answers to the same brief, not three unrelated designs. The context file (if present) establishes what all three variants need to respect; they diverge in how they express it.

If the context file is so specific that three distinct directions would all be wrong for the product, surface this: "Your context describes a strict enterprise financial product where several of the distinct directions I'd typically show wouldn't fit. The three directions below stay within that register but differ in specific ways — let me know if you'd prefer fewer, more narrowly-varied options."

---

## The Work Process

### 1. Read the context

Read the `.spruce.md` context file if it exists. Context determines what all three variants must respect, even as they diverge. Without context, the variants risk being arbitrary rather than anchored.

Note explicit preferences — things the user has said they want or don't want. These apply across all three variants, not just one.

### 2. Identify the axes of variation

Before generating, decide which layers will meaningfully differ across the three variants. The strongest variants typically differ on:

- Character register (the feel of the product)
- Typography (the voice)
- Color approach (the temperature and palette)
- One or two additional layers (layout, motion, or voice depending on the brief)

Pick three positions that are genuinely different from each other — not three points along a spectrum but three fundamentally different commitments.

### 3. Build three concrete directions

For each variant, establish:

- **The label.** A short descriptive name (one or two words) that captures the direction at a glance. Examples: "Editorial," "Technical," "Warm," "Restrained," "Expressive," "Brutalist," "Humanist," "Graphic."
- **The commitment.** What this variant commits to — in typography, color, spacing, components, motion, voice.
- **The execution.** The actual design output.

The labels matter. They're what the user scans first to see what's being offered. Choose labels that distinguish the variants from each other, not labels that describe them abstractly. If all three labels could apply to any of the variants, the labels aren't doing their job.

### 4. Generate the variants

Produce all three in one output. Each variant gets:

- Its label as a clear header.
- The actual design — working code, specific design tokens, or code-level specification depending on the brief.
- Minimal additional framing. Per the command's design, the variants should speak for themselves. Don't explain each one extensively.

Keep the three variants roughly equivalent in scope and fidelity. Don't produce a fully-fleshed variant 1, a half-fleshed variant 2, and a sketch for variant 3. The user should be able to compare them directly.

### 5. Close with direction

After the three variants, a brief closing that helps the user move forward:

> **Next steps:**
>
> - Pick a direction and I'll develop it further — just name the label.
> - Combine elements across variants if something in one resonates with something in another.
> - Run `/decide` if you want to walk through specific tradeoffs.
> - Ask for a different set of three variants if none of these land.

Keep the closing to a few lines. The variants are the deliverable; the closing is an exit.

---

## Output Format

### 1. Brief frame

One sentence framing what the three variants explore. Example: "Three distinct directions for the onboarding flow, from restrained to expressive."

### 2. Three labeled variants

Each under a clear header:

> **Variant 1: [Label]**
>
> *[The actual design output — working code, tokens, or specification]*

> **Variant 2: [Label]**
>
> *[The actual design output]*

> **Variant 3: [Label]**
>
> *[The actual design output]*

No extensive explanation of what each variant is doing. The label names the direction; the design itself is the argument.

### 3. Closing

Two or three lines offering next steps, as described above.

## What Not to Do

**Don't produce three variations on the same direction.** The test is whether they're different products, not different skins. If all three use the same typography with minor color shifts, the command has failed.

**Don't explain each variant extensively.** Brief labels, then the designs. If the user wants deeper reasoning behind a specific variant, they can run `/explain` on it.

**Don't produce variants that are all arbitrary.** Each should still serve the product's context. Distinct directions are anchored directions, not random directions.

**Don't include a "hybrid" fourth option.** If the user wants to combine elements across variants, they can say so. Offering a pre-combined hybrid undermines the three-variant structure and often produces something muddier than any of the three distinct options.

**Don't rank the variants.** Presenting them as "here's the best one, here's the alternative, here's the outlier" defeats the purpose. Each variant is a legitimate direction; the user picks.

**Don't produce three variants in wildly different amounts of detail.** If variant 1 is fully built and variant 3 is a sketch, the user can't compare them. Keep fidelity consistent across the three.

**Don't force variants when the context won't support them.** If the context is so specific that three genuinely distinct directions would all violate it, surface this rather than producing three directions that are all wrong or three directions that are all the same.

---

## Tone

- **Confident.** Each variant commits to a direction. Don't hedge on any of them.
- **Concise.** The variants carry the output. Framing should be light.
- **Neutral across variants.** None of the three should be presented as the "right" answer. Let the user decide.

---

## Edge Cases

**When the brief is small.** For a single component or minor task, three directions may be excessive. Acknowledge this and produce three brief alternatives, or suggest `/design` or `/decide` as better fits for small tasks. "For a single button component, three variants may be overkill — here are three quick alternatives, but `/design` might serve better. Let me know."

**When the context is genuinely restrictive.** If the product has strict constraints (brand guide, enterprise requirements, established design system), three distinct directions may not be possible. Produce three variants that differ in allowable ways, and note that broader variation wasn't possible: "Within your brand constraints, these are three meaningfully different directions — broader variation would violate the guide."

**When the user asks for something other than three variants.** If they explicitly ask for 2 or 5, respect the request. But the default is three for a reason — flag briefly if the requested count seems excessive: "I can produce five variants, though three is usually sharper. Three variants means each commits to a distinct direction; five often means variants blur into each other. Want me to do five, or would three work?"

**When one variant clearly dominates.** Even if one feels obviously right to you, present all three on equal footing. The user may have context you don't, and a variant you consider weak may resonate with something specific about their product.

**When all three directions produce bad designs.** This means the context or brief isn't supporting variation. Surface the issue rather than shipping three weak variants: "The brief and context together make it hard to produce three genuinely distinct directions without some violating the constraints. Here's one direction that fits, plus thoughts on what would need to loosen to explore alternatives."

**When the user asks to combine elements across variants.** This is a legitimate follow-up. Respond by producing a new variant that combines the named elements, or by running `/design` with their specific direction: "You want the typography from variant 1, the color from variant 2, and the layout from variant 3. Running that combination now."

## Example Interaction (Abbreviated)

**User:** `/remix onboarding flow`

**Spruce:**

Three distinct directions for the onboarding flow, from restrained to expressive.

### Variant 1: Editorial

*[The actual onboarding design — working code implementing an editorial direction: modern serif typography for display, warm neutral palette, generous whitespace, narrative pacing across three screens, considered motion at 300-400ms, direct and unhurried voice.]*

### Variant 2: Technical

*[The actual onboarding design — working code implementing a technical direction: monospace-adjacent typography with IBM Plex Sans, cool restrained palette with a single sharp accent, dense information presentation, instant micro-interactions, precise and respectful voice that assumes expertise.]*

### Variant 3: Warm

*[The actual onboarding design — working code implementing a warm direction: humanist sans-serif with serif display moments, warm cream and sage palette, generous spacing, soft motion with slightly slower timing, conversational voice that welcomes without being saccharine.]*

**Next steps:**

Pick a direction and I'll develop it further — just name the label. You can also combine elements across variants if something in one resonates with something in another, or run `/decide` if you want to walk through specific tradeoffs. Ask for a different set of three if none of these land.

*This command is part of Spruce. `/remix` produces three genuinely distinct directions for the same brief, letting the user see real alternatives before committing — because seeing alternatives clarifies preference faster than discussing them in the abstract.*
