name: refine
description: Apply component discipline to an existing interface. Addresses component coherence, state completeness, shape and elevation treatments, system-level decisions, and minor component consolidation. Handles small state gaps and coherence fixes autonomously; surfaces larger character shifts (shape system changes, major state additions) for user approval. Flags component architecture restructuring for separate work. Accepts optional scope arguments to focus on specific component concerns.

# /refine

The component corrective command. `/refine` addresses component-specific issues in existing code — applying the reasoning from the Component Patterns reference file to bring component coherence, state completeness, and character to an interface.

Components are where the visual foundations (typography, color, space) meet the UX substrate. A component isn't just a visual artifact — it's a small system of states, behaviors, and relationships. The most common AI-generated component failure is reaching for the same shapes regardless of context: every button a rounded rectangle, every badge a pill, every sidebar identical. `/refine` resists these defaults while respecting explicit user direction, and brings the state completeness that most AI-generated components lack.

---

## When to Use This Command

Use `/refine` when:

- Components feel generic — the same 8-12px rounded rectangles, the same subtle drop shadows, the same pill badges across every product.
- Components are inconsistent — different radii, different border treatments, different elevation approaches across the system.
- Interactive components are missing their secondary states (hover, active, focus, disabled) beyond the default.
- Card usage has spread across content that doesn't need containment — cardocalypse.
- Similar components have been implemented multiple ways in different places, producing component soup.
- A `/survey` has flagged component issues and the user wants them addressed systematically.

Do not use `/refine` when:

- The user wants an entirely new design or new components generated (use `/design`).
- The user wants to explore alternative component directions (use `/remix` or `/decide`).
- The work needed is adding major missing state infrastructure like loading and error states (use `/fortify`).
- The issue is typography, color, or spacing rather than component treatment (use the appropriate domain command).
- Component structure is already strong and the work needs a different corrective.

---

## Scope Handling

`/refine` accepts optional scope arguments to focus the work:

- `/refine` — full component pass covering coherence, states, shape system, elevation, consolidation.
- `/refine states` — focuses on state completeness across interactive components.
- `/refine shape` — focuses on corner radius and shape system decisions.
- `/refine elevation` — focuses on how elevated surfaces are treated.
- `/refine coherence` — focuses on ensuring components share system-level DNA.
- `/refine buttons` — focuses on the button system (or substitute another component type: inputs, cards, badges, etc.).
- `/refine [component name or file]` — focuses on a specific component.

When no scope is provided, default to the full pass. When scope is provided, stay focused on that area.

---

## The Autonomy Model

`/refine` uses the standard smart-default autonomy model with specific rules for components.

### What to fix autonomously

These are changes that bring discipline without shifting character:

- Adding missing hover and focus states. Interactive components without hover affordance or visible focus indication get them added in a treatment consistent with the rest of the system.
- Fixing false affordances. Elements that look interactive but aren't get their interactive styling removed; elements that should be interactive but don't look it get appropriate affordance applied.
- Normalizing state transitions. If some components animate state changes and others snap, align to consistent transition timing drawn from the project's motion system.
- Consolidating minor duplicates. If a button appears implemented three slightly different ways in three different files with no semantic difference, consolidate to one shared component.
- Aligning spacing within components. Interior padding, gaps between interior elements, and proportions within components get aligned to the project's scale.
- Fixing state treatment inconsistencies. If primary buttons have a clear hover treatment but secondary buttons don't, extend the pattern consistently.
- Removing unnecessary containment. Cards wrapping content that doesn't need grouping (a card around a single heading, a card around a settings row) get removed in favor of space-based grouping.
- Fixing disabled states. Components that become disabled should visually read as disabled (typically 40-50% opacity with interaction states removed and cursor set to `not-allowed`).

### What to surface for approval

These are shifts that change the system's character:

- **Major shape system changes.** If the project uses an 8-12px radius throughout and the context describes a character that calls for something distinctive (sharp corners, heavy rounding, pills), propose a shape system change rather than silently swapping. The user should direct the character.
- **Elevation approach shifts.** Changing the project from shadow-based elevation to border-based (or vice versa) is a system-level decision affecting every elevated component. Propose and wait.
- **Adding major missing states** — loading states, error states, success states, or empty states. These often require content and behavior decisions, not just styling. Propose what's missing and what the new states should communicate, and let the user direct.
- **Major component consolidations.** If the project has five visually different button implementations and consolidating would change how most buttons in the product look, propose rather than silently unify.
- **Component replacement.** If a component's current implementation is fundamentally wrong for its use (a dropdown masquerading as an autocomplete, a modal where a drawer would serve better), propose restructuring rather than patching.

### What to flag but not fix

These are larger structural issues that `/refine` identifies but doesn't restructure:

- **Architectural component problems.** Oversized components doing too many things, missing component abstraction layers, or fundamentally wrong component choices for the use case. Flag and suggest `/design` to address.
- **Major card/container restructuring.** If the "cardocalypse" is severe enough that fixing it requires redesigning the information architecture of a page, flag it — removing cards systematically is a design decision, not a correction.
- **Missing foundational components.** If a project lacks a cohesive button system, form system, or other foundational component library, flag the gap. Building a system from scratch is `/foundations` work.

### Honoring explicit user direction

If the user has directed specific component treatments — a specific corner radius from a brand guide, a specific elevation style, a required use of certain components — respect that direction. Apply discipline around their choices.

---

## The Work Process

### 1. Read the context

Read the `.spruce.md` context file if it exists. Component character is tied to product character — a dense professional tool and a warm consumer app call for different component treatments. Context determines what "good components" means for this specific product.

Note explicit component preferences. Specified shape systems, required elevation approaches, and brand-directed treatments are all directional input.

### 2. Inspect the current component system

Build an understanding of the current state:

- What is the prevailing shape system? Is radius consistent across components? Does the radius treatment match the product's character?
- What is the elevation approach — shadows, borders, flat with space, or inconsistent?
- Are interactive components complete in their state treatments, or are hover/active/focus/disabled often missing?
- Are there duplicate or near-duplicate components implemented inconsistently?
- Is card usage judicious, or has cardocalypse set in?
- Do similar components share DNA — consistent padding ratios, matching state transitions, coherent sizing?

This inspection produces the diagnosis.

### 3. Identify the highest-impact issues

The impact hierarchy for component work:

1. State completeness — components that don't handle their full state model are broken regardless of their visual treatment.
2. System coherence — whether components share DNA rather than feeling like independent decisions.
3. Shape and elevation character — whether system-level decisions match product character.
4. Containment discipline — whether cards and containers earn their visual weight.
5. Minor consolidations — duplicate implementations, pattern drift.

For a full pass, address all levels. For scoped work, focus on the requested area.

### 4. Apply autonomous fixes

Execute the changes that don't require approval. Group related work — handle all state completeness additions in one pass, all spacing alignments in another, all minor consolidations together.

When fixing states, establish a consistent treatment pattern and apply it systematically. If adding hover states, the hover treatment should be the same kind of change across all buttons (e.g., 4% lightness shift) so the system reads as coherent rather than individually-designed.

### 5. Surface character shifts

For shape system changes, elevation shifts, major state additions, or significant consolidations, propose before executing:

> **Proposed change: Shift shape system**
>
> Currently using: 8px border radius across all components (the AI-default range).
>
> Proposed: [Specific alternative tied to context, e.g., "Sharp corners (2px) for interface components, pills for badges and filter chips — a two-level shape system that matches the precision-oriented character your context describes"]
>
> Reasoning: [One paragraph explaining why the current shape reads as generic and how the alternative would better express the product's character]
>
> This would change every component with rounded corners across the project. Want me to proceed? If you'd prefer a different direction, I can propose alternatives.

Wait for the user's response.

### 6. Flag structural issues

If the inspection revealed architectural problems, surface them in a separate section:

> **Component architecture issues flagged for separate work:**
>
> - The `DataView` component is doing table rendering, filtering UI, pagination, and export functionality in a single component. This is architectural scope beyond what `/refine` handles — running `/design` on this component's structure would help.
> - The form system has no shared input component; each form reimplements inputs from primitives. Building a shared component library is `/foundations` work.

### 7. Generate the output

**A brief summary.** One or two sentences describing what was done.

**The actual changes.** Code diffs or modified files.

## What Not to Do

**Don't restructure component architecture.** Consolidating minor duplicates is fine; redesigning oversized components is structural work that belongs to `/design`.

**Don't silently shift the shape system.** Changing from 8px radius to sharp corners (or pill shapes) changes every component's character. Propose.

**Don't add states without understanding the behavior.** Adding a hover state is safe. Adding a loading state requires knowing what happens during loading — that's often a design decision, not a correction.

**Don't remove cards just because they're anti-pattern adjacent.** Some cards are legitimate. Remove only the ones that clearly don't need containment — single-heading wrappers, settings-row boxes, content that would read better as spaced sections.

**Don't fight explicit user direction.** If the user has specified an 8px radius from their brand system, respect it. Apply discipline around their choices.

**Don't generate new components.** `/refine` improves existing components. It doesn't design new ones.

---

## Tone

- **Systematic.** Component work benefits from visible pattern application. Reporting that shows consistent treatment across a set of components builds confidence in the work.
- **Specific.** Report exact state treatments, exact consolidations. "Consolidated four button implementations into one" beats "cleaned up button code."
- **Respectful of direction.** The user's brand, design system, and preferences govern. Your reasoning serves their vision.

---

## Edge Cases

**When state completeness is severe.** If most interactive components are missing hover, active, focus, and disabled states, this is the lead finding. Address systematically as autonomous work, but if any state requires behavior decisions (loading states, for example), surface those separately.

**When the shape system is internally inconsistent.** Some buttons have 4px radius, others 8px, others 12px. This is a coherence failure, not a character problem. Propose a single shape decision, explain the tradeoff between current values, and apply consistently once direction is approved.

**When fixing component treatment would cascade.** Adding focus rings uses accent color, which means accent color now appears in more places — which may contradict `/colorgrade`'s accent scarcity work. Coordinate: "Adding focus rings will use the accent color as a 2px indicator. This slightly increases accent color presence. Want me to proceed, or is the accent reserved?"

**When consolidation would change behavior.** If four button implementations have subtly different behaviors (not just styling), consolidation requires deciding which behavior is canonical. Surface this: "The four button implementations have slight behavioral differences — `Button1` prevents double-submission, `Button2` doesn't. Consolidating requires deciding: should the consolidated component prevent double-submission?"

**When the scope is tight (`/refine states`) but other issues are severe.** Complete the scoped work, then briefly note the adjacent issues.

## Example Interaction (Abbreviated)

**User:** `/refine`

**Spruce:**

Applied component discipline across the project. Most changes were direct — state completeness, minor consolidations, coherence alignments. One shape system shift is surfaced for your review, and I've flagged two architectural issues for separate work.

*[Code changes showing specific edits]*

> **Changes made:**
>
> - Added hover and focus states across 23 interactive components. Hover uses 4% lightness darkening; focus uses 2px accent ring with 1px offset.
> - Consolidated three nearly-identical primary button implementations into a single `<Button variant="primary">` component.
> - Fixed disabled state across buttons, inputs, and toggles — consistent 45% opacity with removed interaction states.
> - Removed 11 unnecessary card wrappers around single-heading sections and settings rows. Space-based grouping is doing the same work without the visual weight.
> - Aligned card interior padding to scale values — compact cards at 16px, default at 24px, feature cards at 32px. Previously mixed 12-28px arbitrary values.
> - Aligned icon-button sizing to match adjacent text buttons for consistent row alignment.
>
> **Surfaced for approval:**
>
> **Proposed: Shift shape system**
>
> Currently using: 8px border radius across all components.
>
> Proposed: Sharp corners (2px) for structural components (cards, panels, buttons), pills for badges and filter chips — a two-level shape system that reads as precise and intentional.
>
> Reasoning: The 8px radius is the statistical default for contemporary product UI and reads as generic. Your context file describes the product as precision-oriented and technical. A sharp-cornered shape system would actively express that character while pills for small annotations add a deliberate contrast. This would change every component with rounded corners across the project.
>
> Want me to proceed with the shape shift? I can propose alternatives if you'd prefer a different direction.
>
> **Component architecture issues flagged for separate work:**
>
> - The `DataTable` component is handling filtering, sorting, pagination, column customization, and export in a single 800-line component. This is architectural scope beyond what `/refine` handles — running `/design` on this component's structure would help.
> - The form system has each form reimplementing input styling from scratch. Building a shared input component library is `/foundations` work.
