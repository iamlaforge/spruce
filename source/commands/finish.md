name: finish
description: Apply final polish to an existing interface across all seven Spruce dimensions. Handles small refinements (craft details, minor inconsistencies, final tightening) that bring an interface from complete to ship-ready. Delegates substantial work to specific correctives (/typeface, /colorgrade, etc.) rather than attempting major changes. Produces a ship-readiness report identifying what was polished and any remaining concerns. Use as the last step before deployment.

# /finish

The ship-ready polish command. `/finish` is the last corrective run before deployment — it addresses the small details that accumulate into perceived quality, identifies any remaining concerns, and produces a confidence signal about whether the interface is genuinely ready to ship.

`/finish` is deliberately scoped to polish. It handles craft details, final inconsistencies, and the small accumulated refinements across all seven Spruce dimensions. It does not do substantial corrective work — if major typography, color, spacing, component, motion, voice, or production readiness issues exist, `/finish` flags them and recommends running the appropriate dedicated command first. The idea is that by the time `/finish` runs, the heavy work has been done and only the final tightening remains.

---

## When to Use This Command

Use `/finish` when:

- The interface is approaching deployment and needs a final quality pass.
- Substantial corrective work has been completed (typography, color, components, states, etc.) and what remains is small refinements.
- The user wants a confidence signal about ship-readiness plus any last concerns identified.
- The project is being handed off, submitted, or published and deserves a final craft pass.

Do not use `/finish` when:

- The interface has significant unresolved issues in a specific domain (run the dedicated corrective first — `/typeface`, `/colorgrade`, `/refine`, `/fortify`, etc.).
- The user wants a comprehensive review with findings (use `/survey`).
- Major design decisions are still unresolved (use `/decide` or `/design`).
- State completeness and accessibility are substantially missing (use `/fortify` first).

---

## Scope Handling

`/finish` accepts an optional scope argument to narrow the polish:

- `/finish` — full polish pass across all seven dimensions.
- `/finish [page or area]` — polish focused on a specific surface, useful when a particular area is being shipped.

The `/finish` command doesn't accept domain-specific scope arguments (like `/finish typography`) because domain-specific polish work belongs to the domain commands (`/typeface`, `/colorgrade`, etc.). `/finish` is explicitly the cross-domain final pass.

---

## The Polish Scope

`/finish` addresses small refinements across every domain. The work is intentionally light-touch.

### Typography polish

- Final craft details: remaining straight quotes to smart quotes, any missed tabular figure enablements, letter-spacing on any overlooked all-caps labels.
- Minor line-height tightening where values feel slightly off but aren't obviously wrong.
- `text-wrap: balance` or `text-wrap: pretty` on headlines and paragraphs that would benefit.
- Removing accidental font-weight applications that create orphan weights in the system.
- Tightening heading asymmetry where symmetric margins were missed in earlier passes.

### Color polish

- Tightening contrast ratios that are technically passing but feel close to the minimum.
- Aligning any neutrals that drifted slightly during other work.
- Ensuring hover and active state darkening is consistent across similar components.
- Verifying that accent color scarcity is preserved — removing any accent that crept back in during other corrective work.
- Final dark mode pass for consistency if dark mode exists.

### Spatial polish

- Final alignment pass — catching any elements that aren't aligning to the grid.
- Normalizing any spacing values that drifted from the scale.
- Tightening the asymmetry of heading margins where they've become symmetric again.
- Verifying consistent section padding across the project.
- Checking that measure discipline is maintained in reading contexts.

### Component polish

- Fixing any inconsistencies in state treatment across similar components (hover darkening values, focus ring treatments, disabled opacity).
- Ensuring similar components share interior padding and proportional relationships.
- Verifying card treatment consistency where cards are used.
- Catching any remaining false affordances or inconsistent interactive treatment.

### Motion polish

- Ensuring transition timing is consistent across similar interactions.
- Verifying `prefers-reduced-motion` handling is complete.
- Catching any animations that drift from the motion system's duration and easing tokens.

### Voice polish

- Catching any remaining terminology drift.
- Tightening any copy that's close to the voice but could be more specific.
- Checking that destructive action copy is consistent in its consequence-description pattern.
- Verifying that success confirmations are specific rather than generic.

### Production readiness polish

- Verifying focus states are consistent across new or modified interactive elements.
- Ensuring any ARIA attributes added have been applied consistently.
- Final contrast check on state changes (focus, error, success) — these often drift below minimums when other color work is done.
- Verifying that no copy leaked technical content (`null`, `undefined`, raw error codes).

## The Autonomy Model

`/finish` applies polish autonomously. The whole point of the command is that by this stage, the user wants refinement rather than another round of decisions.

What `/finish` does not do autonomously:

- **Does not make character-level changes.** No typeface swaps, no palette shifts, no density changes, no voice character changes. If these are needed, they should have been handled before `/finish`.
- **Does not add missing infrastructure.** No building missing states, no adding missing accessibility, no introducing motion where none exists. These are `/fortify` concerns.
- **Does not restructure.** No layout changes, no component architecture shifts, no IA changes.

If `/finish` encounters issues that fall outside polish scope, it flags them in the ship-readiness report rather than attempting to address them.

---

## The Work Process

### 1. Read the context

Read the `.spruce.md` context file if it exists. Polish is calibrated to product character — what counts as "properly tight" spacing depends on whether the product is spacious or dense, what counts as "voice-appropriate" copy depends on the established register.

### 2. Brief inspection

Run a quick pass across all seven dimensions to identify what polish work is available and what substantial issues remain. This is not a formal survey — it's a rapid diagnostic to understand the state of the work.

Look for:

- Polish opportunities: small refinements in each domain that `/finish` can handle.
- Substantial issues: problems in any domain that exceed polish scope and require a dedicated corrective.
- Ship-blockers: critical issues that must be addressed before deployment regardless of who handles them.

### 3. Apply polish systematically

Work through each domain, applying the specific polish items from the scope above. Keep the work light-touch — this is not a re-run of each corrective, it's the final tightening.

Group related polish work across domains when it makes sense. For example, if polishing component hover states involves color adjustments and motion timing, handle those together rather than passing through the code twice.

### 4. Flag substantial issues for dedicated work

Anything that exceeds polish scope gets flagged, not fixed. Be specific about what's needed and which command would handle it:

- "Typography: The body typeface (Inter) reads as generic for this editorial product. This is a character decision beyond polish scope — run `/typeface` to address."
- "Motion: The interface has no loading states at all — not a polish concern, a missing infrastructure concern. Run `/fortify` to add them."
- "Voice: The error messages throughout describe failures rather than fixes. This is a systematic rewrite beyond polish scope — run `/voice`."

### 5. Produce the ship-readiness report

After polish work and flagging, produce a concise report on ship-readiness. This is the distinguishing feature of `/finish`.

The report has three parts:

**Overall assessment.** A one-paragraph judgment on whether the interface is ready to ship. Be direct — "ready to ship," "ready to ship with minor items noted," "needs additional work before shipping," or "significant issues to address before shipping."

**What was polished.** A bulleted list of the polish work applied. Keep it concise — this is not a full change log, it's a summary of the final touches.

**Remaining concerns.** Anything flagged during inspection that exceeds polish scope. Group by severity: ship-blockers (must address before shipping), substantial items (should address, but not critical), minor items (can ship without but worth addressing eventually).

### 6. Generate the output

**A brief frame.** One sentence: "Ran final polish across the project. Details and ship-readiness assessment below."

**The actual changes.** Code diffs for the polish work applied.

**The ship-readiness report.**

> **Ship-readiness assessment:** [direct judgment in one sentence]

> *Substantial items (not blocking but worth addressing):*
> - [issues worth addressing but not blocking]
>
> *Minor items (can ship without, worth noting):*
> - [items that would improve the work but don't block shipping]

**A brief closing.** "Run the recommended commands to address flagged items, or ship as-is if the concerns are acceptable for this release. Happy to run specific correctives if helpful."

---

## What Not to Do

**Don't do substantial work disguised as polish.** Swapping a typeface is not polish. Rewriting error messages systemically is not polish. Establishing states where none exist is not polish. If the work requires a specific corrective command, flag it — don't absorb it into `/finish`.

**Don't produce a ship-ready report when the project isn't ship-ready.** If substantial issues remain, say so plainly. The report's value depends on its honesty.

**Don't pad the polish.** If the interface is well-polished and little remains, the change list will be short. Say so. A one-line report saying "the project is in good shape" is stronger than a padded list of marginal tweaks.

**Don't re-run other correctives.** `/finish` is the cross-dimensional polish sweep, not a re-run of any single dimensional corrective. If the user has already run `/typeface`, `/colorgrade`, `/refine`, `/pace`, `/voice`, etc., trust that work as the established direction. Polish only the small drift that's accumulated across dimensions since (a missed smart quote here, a contrast value that's close to minimum there, one focus ring offset that drifted) — not the substantial decisions those correctives already made. The value of `/finish` is touching every dimension lightly in one pass; the moment it starts re-doing dimensional work, it's stopped being polish and become redundant correction.

**Don't introduce new patterns.** Polish is tightening existing patterns, not introducing new ones. If the project could benefit from a new approach (new token scale, new voice convention), that's design work, not polish.

---

## Tone

- **Confident.** By the time `/finish` runs, the heavy work is done. Polish reporting should be crisp and brief.
- **Honest about readiness.** The ship-readiness assessment is the value of the command. Don't hedge — say whether it's ready or not.
- **Light-touch.** Polish is a specific kind of work. The tone and approach should reflect that — not exhaustive, not performative.

---

## Edge Cases

**When the project is genuinely ship-ready with nothing to polish.** Say so directly. "Ran the polish pass. The project is in strong shape — no polish changes needed. Ship-ready with no concerns noted." A short output is a strong output.

**When substantial issues are severe enough to recommend against shipping.** Be direct in the assessment. "Ship-readiness: needs significant work before shipping. Several substantial issues identified below that exceed polish scope — recommend addressing these before considering the project ready."

**When polish exposes substantial issues that weren't visible before.** Sometimes tightening reveals larger problems. If polish work surfaces something that can't be polished away, flag it in the report and note that it emerged during the pass.

**When the user asks `/finish` on a scope that isn't ready for polish.** If the scope has major issues, redirect before applying light polish to a foundation that needs work. "The scope you've asked to finish still has substantial issues that should be addressed before polish. Recommend running [specific commands] first, then `/finish` will be more useful."

**When polish could affect a larger area than just the scope.** If polishing one component reveals inconsistency that spans the project, note the broader issue rather than polishing only within the scope. "Polish within this scope is done. Worth noting: the hover state treatment varies across the project — this scope now uses consistent treatment, but other components drift. Consider a project-wide `/refine` pass to align."

## Example Interaction (Abbreviated)

**User:** `/finish`

**Spruce:**

Ran final polish across the project. Details and ship-readiness assessment below.

*[Code changes showing polish edits]*

> **Ship-readiness assessment:** Ready to ship with minor items noted below.
>
> **What was polished:**
> - Caught three remaining straight quotes and converted to smart quotes.
> - Enabled `text-wrap: balance` on six headlines that were producing orphan words.
> - Tightened heading asymmetry on four h2 elements that had drifted back to symmetric margins.
> - Normalized hover darkening values across buttons, inputs, and cards to consistent 4% lightness shift.
> - Fixed one contrast edge case — tertiary metadata in dark mode was at 4.3:1, adjusted to 5.1:1.
> - Verified `prefers-reduced-motion` handling on the three animations added after the last `/pace` run.
> - Caught one instance of `undefined` appearing in an error message template — replaced with human-readable fallback.
> - Aligned focus ring offset to consistent 1px across all interactive elements (some had drifted to 2px offset during component work).
>
> **Remaining concerns:**
>
> *Ship-blockers:*
> - None identified.
>
> *Substantial items (not blocking but worth addressing):*
> - The mobile layout of the pricing page has tight touch targets on the tier selection cards — below 44×44px recommended minimum. Not a blocker for desktop shipping but worth addressing before mobile users encounter it. Run `/arrange responsive` or address in next iteration.
>
> *Minor items (can ship without, worth noting):*
> - The team management page still uses the card-grid pattern that was flagged during `/reduce`. It works for current team sizes but will become exhausting at scale. Monitor and address when team sizes grow.
> - Two empty states in rarely-visited admin sections use slightly different three-part structure than the rest of the project. Minor inconsistency, low user impact.

Run the recommended commands to address flagged items, or ship as-is if the concerns are acceptable for this release. Happy to run specific correctives if helpful.

*This command is part of Spruce. `/finish` is the final step — small refinements across every dimension that bring an interface from complete to ship-ready, plus an honest assessment of whether it's genuinely ready to deploy.*
