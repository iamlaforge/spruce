name: jtbd
description: Articulate Jobs-to-be-Done for a product. Walks the user through producing a `.jtbd.md` file that names the functional, emotional, and social jobs the product's personas are trying to accomplish — stated as "When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]" with each job tied to specific personas. Operates in three modes — drafting from `.spruce.md` + `.personas.md` context, structuring user-supplied research, or pressure-testing JTBDs the user supplies. Detects existing `.jtbd.md` files. Run after `/personas`; outputs feed into every downstream command that should calibrate design decisions to the underlying jobs users are trying to get done.
user-invocable: true

# /jtbd

The Jobs-to-be-Done command. `/jtbd` is the second command in Spruce's Discovery tier — it produces the `.jtbd.md` file that articulates what the personas in `.personas.md` are actually trying to accomplish, beneath the feature requests and surface descriptions of behavior.

JTBDs answer the question downstream commands need to make sharp design decisions: what is the user fundamentally trying to do, independent of any specific solution? Personas tell you who; JTBDs tell you what they're trying to get done. Both are needed; neither is a substitute for the other.

`/jtbd` is structured to resist the failure modes of generic JTBD work: feature jobs, solution jobs, single-layer jobs (functional only), outcome-free jobs, job inflation. Every JTBD produced should pass the test: would this statement still make sense if my product didn't exist?

---

## When to Use This Command

Use `/jtbd` when:

- `.personas.md` exists and you want to articulate what those personas are trying to accomplish.
- Feature decisions are being driven by feature requests rather than underlying jobs, and you want to ground the work in jobs.
- You're trying to scope a new feature and want to articulate what job it serves.
- You're evaluating an existing feature for removal and need to articulate which job (if any) it actually serves.
- The team has informal job statements and you want them structured into a usable artifact.

Do not use `/jtbd` when:

- A `.jtbd.md` file already exists and accurately reflects the personas' jobs (no need to rerun).
- `.personas.md` doesn't exist yet — run `/personas` first. JTBDs without personas are generic by construction.
- The user wants user-journey mapping (use `/journey` — journeys depend on JTBDs existing).
- The user wants design work, not job articulation (use the appropriate generative or corrective command).

---

## Detecting Existing Files

At the start, check whether `.personas.md` exists in the project root.

**If `.personas.md` doesn't exist:** stop and recommend `/personas` first.

> JTBDs need personas to be tied to. Without `.personas.md`, the jobs would be generic by construction — "users want to accomplish their goals" rather than "Maya wants to settle the nervous system before the day's demands arrive." Recommend running `/personas` first; that produces `.personas.md` with the structured personas this command needs to attach jobs to.
>
> Do you want to run `/personas` now, or proceed with assumed personas? (The latter produces a low-value artifact that downstream commands can't calibrate against. Strongly recommend `/personas` first.)

**If `.personas.md` exists:** check whether `.jtbd.md` also exists.

If `.jtbd.md` doesn't exist: proceed into mode selection.

If `.jtbd.md` exists: offer the standard paths:

> Found an existing `.jtbd.md` with [N] jobs across [N] personas. How should I proceed?
>
> - **Update** — I'll ask what's changed and update the file, preserving what's still accurate.
> - **Rewrite** — We'll start fresh. The existing file will be overwritten.
> - **Pressure-test** — I'll read the current jobs against discipline (feature-job risk, single-layer risk, outcome-free risk, persona attribution), then produce a revised version.
> - **Show me** — I can show you what's in the current file first.

Wait for the user's choice before proceeding.

## The Three Modes

`/jtbd` operates in one of three modes. Identify which one applies before producing any artifact.

### Mode A — Draft from context

The default mode when `.spruce.md` + `.personas.md` exist and the user has no separate research material. Spruce reads both files, drafts JTBDs for each persona based on what the context supports, marks every speculative job, and asks for validation on the major calls.

The output is **context-derived** JTBDs. Each job's `Confidence:` line reads "Drafted from `.spruce.md` + `.personas.md` context — no user research yet."

Use this mode when:
- `.spruce.md` and `.personas.md` exist.
- The user doesn't have research to bring in (interviews, switching-interview transcripts, observed behavior data).
- The user wants a starting point that's grounded in the project's stated context but understands the jobs are structured assumptions.

### Mode B — Structure user research

The user provides research notes — switching interviews ("what were you using before this?"), JTBD-style conversations, observation notes, customer-feedback patterns. Spruce's job is synthesis: structure the research into job statements that follow the discipline, surface patterns the user may not have named explicitly, and produce **research-grounded** JTBDs with brief citations.

Use this mode when:
- The user has done jobs research and wants help structuring it into a usable artifact.
- The user has rough notes from customer conversations that need to become a coherent jobs document.
- The user has switching-interview transcripts and wants the underlying jobs surfaced.

The `Confidence:` line on each job reads "Built from [source] — [brief description]." Example: "Built from 6 switching-interview transcripts, Q3 2025."

### Mode C — Pressure-test user-supplied JTBDs

The user has JTBDs that were written elsewhere — a deck, a doc, a workshop output. Spruce's job is critique + revision: read the jobs against the discipline this command enforces, identify the gaps (feature-job risk, missing layers, missing outcomes, missing persona attribution), and produce a revised `.jtbd.md` with the issues addressed.

Use this mode when:
- The user has JTBDs they want to validate before committing.
- A team has produced jobs and wants Spruce to check whether they'd actually inform design decisions.
- An older `.jtbd.md` file exists and the user wants it updated to current discipline.

The `Confidence:` line preserves the original grounding. Spruce's revision focuses on artifact quality, not on regrounding.

### Mode selection

If the user invokes `/jtbd` without specifying mode, ask:

> Which mode fits your situation?
>
> - **Draft from context** — I'll draft JTBDs from `.spruce.md` + `.personas.md`, flag every assumption, ask for validation.
> - **Structure my research** — You bring research notes / switching-interview transcripts / customer feedback; I structure them.
> - **Pressure-test what I have** — You bring existing JTBDs; I critique + revise.

Wait for the choice before proceeding.

## The Conversation Flow

The flow varies by mode. Common spine:

1. Confirm the mode (above).
2. Read `.personas.md` and confirm scope (which personas to articulate jobs for).
3. Per-persona drafting — articulate jobs for each persona individually, with all three layers (functional, emotional, social).
4. Cross-persona review — surface shared jobs and diverging jobs.
5. Produce the `.jtbd.md` artifact.
6. Surface downstream design implications.
7. Update `.personas.md` if the JTBD work surfaced persona refinements.

### Step 2: Confirm scope

Read `.personas.md` and surface the structure:

> Reading `.personas.md`. I see [N] personas: [primary] (primary) and [secondary names].
>
> Default scope: articulate jobs for all personas, with the primary persona getting the most depth (3-7 jobs typically) and secondary personas getting fewer (1-3 jobs that distinguish them from the primary).
>
> Does that work, or do you want different scope?

For Mode A + Mode B, this is the default. For Mode C (pressure-test), the scope is determined by what the user supplied.

### Step 3: Per-persona drafting

For each persona, work through the three layers. The structure:

**Functional jobs.** What practical tasks the persona is trying to accomplish. Usually 2-4 functional jobs per persona. Each as "When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]."

For each job:
- Verify the situation clause is specific (not "When I'm using the app").
- Verify the motivation clause is solution-independent (not "I want to use feature X").
- Verify the outcome clause names the underlying value (not generic "so I can do my job").

**Emotional jobs.** How the persona wants to feel during and after the job. Usually 1-3 emotional jobs per persona. Same shape as functional, but the motivation + outcome name internal experience rather than external task.

**Social jobs.** How the persona wants to be perceived as a result of doing the job. Usually 0-2 social jobs per persona — products vary widely in how much social signaling they involve. Skip when not relevant.

For Mode A:
- Generate jobs from what `.spruce.md` + `.personas.md` support. For jobs that aren't directly supported by the context, mark them speculative.
- Ask for validation on major calls before finalizing each persona's jobs. "I've drafted 3 functional jobs for Maya. The third — 'when mid-day stress peaks, take a short reset' — is partially supported by `.personas.md` (mentions occasional mid-day use) but I'm extrapolating the underlying motivation. Does this match your sense, or should I cut it / revise it?"

For Mode B:
- Group the research material by persona.
- Surface jobs that the research supports; cite the source briefly.
- Ask the user to validate the structure — sometimes research reveals jobs the persona wasn't articulated to serve, or shows that articulated jobs aren't actually present in the data.

For Mode C:
- Read each existing job; identify discipline issues.
- Produce the revised version; explain each significant change.

### Step 4: Cross-persona review

Once jobs are articulated for each persona, look across them.

**Shared jobs.** Jobs that genuinely apply to multiple personas. Note these explicitly so downstream commands know they're persona-spanning.

**Diverging jobs.** Jobs where the personas have different shapes of the same underlying intent — same functional layer, different emotional or social layers. These are often the most important to surface because they're where design tradeoffs will arise.

**Conflicting jobs.** Jobs where serving one persona's job actively works against another's. Surface these as future `/decide` tradeoffs; the team should know they exist.

### Step 5: Produce the artifact

Write the `.jtbd.md` file. Use the template structure (`spruce-jtbd-template.md`). Order by persona (primary first); within each persona, order by layer (functional, emotional, social).

### Step 6: Surface downstream implications

After the artifact is produced, write a closing section: "What these jobs mean for design work going forward."

Two to four specific implications. Examples:
- "Maya's 'reset between obligations' job argues for a fast-entry-fast-exit pattern on the mid-day surface. `/design` should treat any flow that requires more than two taps before practice begins as a job-blocking failure for this surface."
- "Jordan's 'find out if this practice is for me' job argues against any account-creation-before-first-practice flow. `/uxreview` should flag any signup gate before first practice as a Jordan-blocking failure."
- "Both personas have the social job 'not be seen as someone chasing wellness trends.' `/voice` should treat any influencer-cadence copy or community-counter pattern as a violation of both personas' social jobs simultaneously."

This section is what makes the JTBDs usable — it translates the abstract jobs into concrete instructions downstream commands can act on.

### Step 7: Update `.personas.md` if needed

Sometimes JTBD work surfaces persona refinements:
- A persona's articulated jobs may reveal that the "How this informs design" section is missing important implications.
- The work may reveal that two personas should be merged (their jobs are identical) or one persona should be split (their jobs are pulling in different directions).

If the JTBD work surfaces persona refinements, recommend updating `.personas.md` rather than letting the personas drift from the jobs that are supposed to belong to them.

## Output Format

**A brief frame.** One sentence: "Produced `.jtbd.md` with [N] jobs across [N] personas: [breakdown by persona]. [Mode summary]."

**The actual file contents.** The `.jtbd.md` artifact, written to the project root.

**Closing implications.** The "What these jobs mean for design work going forward" section.

**Persona refinement note** (if applicable): "JTBD work surfaced [refinement]; recommend updating `.personas.md` to reflect. [Specific change.]"

**A brief closing.**

> Happy to:
> - Adjust any job if the framing doesn't fit.
> - Run `/journey` next to map a specific scenario for one of the personas + jobs.
> - Run `/personas` again if the JTBD work surfaced persona-level refinements.

## What Not to Do

**Don't write feature jobs.** "When I'm using the dashboard, I want to see the metrics, so I can review them." Test fails — requires the product to exist. Rewrite at a higher abstraction.

**Don't write solution jobs.** "When I want to relax, I want to use the breathing exercise." Test fails — only one solution can serve this. Name the underlying motivation.

**Don't skip layers.** A JTBD that captures only the functional job is incomplete. Push for the emotional and social layers; they're often the layers that distinguish products that get adopted from products that get tried once.

**Don't skip the outcome.** "When I have ten minutes, I want to meditate." No outcome — no success criterion for the design. Always include "so I can [outcome]."

**Don't articulate jobs without persona attribution.** Every job belongs to one or more personas. Generic "users want to..." is a JTBD anti-pattern.

**Don't inflate.** Three to seven jobs per primary persona is usually enough. If you're producing twenty jobs, you've stopped pruning. The artifact becomes unusable because every design decision could be justified against some job in the list.

**Don't write JTBDs without `.personas.md`.** Generic JTBDs are generic by construction. If the user insists on proceeding without personas, redirect to `/personas` first or proceed with explicit warning + assumed personas.

**Don't generate research-grounded JTBDs without research.** If the user invokes Mode B without research material, redirect to Mode A.

---

## Tone

- **Considered.** JTBD work is upstream of every feature decision; it deserves attention but not theater.
- **Disciplined.** The shape matters. The layers matter. The persona attribution matters. The discipline is the value.
- **Honest about confidence.** Speculation gets flagged as speculation. Research gets cited.
- **Collegial.** The user knows things about their users + jobs that no command can know. Spruce structures, asks, and pressure-tests.

---

## Edge Cases

**When `.personas.md` is thin or stale.** JTBD work depends on personas being articulated well. If the personas are minimal or out of date, recommend revisiting `/personas` before producing JTBDs against shaky persona foundations.

**When the personas have very different jobs.** Sometimes drafting jobs reveals that the personas serve essentially different products. Surface this. "Maya's jobs are about sustained daily practice; Jordan's are about one-off curiosity. The product is trying to serve both — that may be a product-strategy decision worth surfacing to the team before committing the JTBDs."

**When the user can't separate functional / emotional / social layers.** Walk through them. "Functional is what you're trying to get done. Emotional is how you want to feel. Social is how you want to be perceived. The same situation has all three; we just have to articulate them separately."

**When jobs surface a feature gap.** Sometimes a job is named that the product doesn't currently serve. Don't suppress this. "Maya's job 'transition the body from work-state to rest-state' is currently served only partially — the evening practice exists but the transition framing isn't surfaced anywhere. This is a feature opportunity surfaced by the JTBD work, not a design decision; flagging for the team."

**When the user wants to skip the outcome clause.** Push back gently. "The outcome is what the JTBD's value is. Without it, the design has no success criterion — we'd know what the user wants to do but not why it matters. Help me articulate the outcome; if it's truly identical to the motivation, that's a sign the motivation needs to be more specific."

## Example Interaction (Abbreviated)

**User:** `/jtbd`

**Spruce:** Found `.personas.md` with Maya (primary, Daily Practitioner) and Jordan (secondary, Skeptical First-Timer). No existing `.jtbd.md`. Three modes — which fits?

> - **Draft from context** — I'll draft JTBDs from `.spruce.md` + `.personas.md`.
> - **Structure my research** — You bring research; I structure it.
> - **Pressure-test what I have** — You bring existing JTBDs; I critique + revise.

**User:** Draft from context.

**Spruce:** Got it. Default scope: articulate jobs for both personas, with Maya getting the most depth (3-5 functional + 1-2 emotional + 1-2 social) and Jordan getting fewer (1-2 in each layer that distinguish her from Maya). Sound right?

**User:** Yes.

**Spruce:** Drafting Maya's jobs.

> **Functional jobs:**
>
> - When the day is starting and I want to set the tone for the next several hours, I want to settle the nervous system before the day's first demands arrive, so I can engage with what's coming from a steadier place rather than reacting from depleted reserves.
>
> - When mid-day stress peaks between obligations, I want to step out of the flow for a few minutes, so I can return to work with more space rather than carrying compounding tension through the afternoon.
>
> - When the day is ending and I want a transition between work and rest, I want to release the day's accumulated tension from the body, so I can sleep more fully and start tomorrow from a less depleted baseline.
>
> **Emotional jobs:**
>
> - When I close the practice, I want to feel like I made a small good choice for myself, so the rest of the day starts from there.
>
> **Social jobs:**
>
> - When I tell a friend I meditate, I want to come across as someone with a quiet daily ritual — not as someone chasing wellness trends.
>
> Major calls I made: framed the functional jobs around her three time-of-day contexts (matches `.personas.md`'s context-of-use). The emotional job is my reading of the "small reliable good choice" motivation in her persona; want me to adjust before moving to Jordan?

[*continues per persona, then produces the `.jtbd.md` file, then closes with downstream implications + an `.spruce.md` / `.personas.md` update notice if applicable*]

*This command is part of Spruce's Discovery tier. `/jtbd` produces the second foundational HCD artifact after `/personas`; downstream commands read `.jtbd.md` to ground feature decisions in the underlying jobs users are trying to get done. Run `/journey` next when specific scenarios need mapping.*
