name: uxreview
description: UX-focused review of an interface, covering information architecture, system feedback, forms, empty states, error recovery, cognitive load, progressive disclosure, interaction contracts, and state completeness. Distinct from /survey by focusing exclusively on the UX substrate — what the interface needs to do and how it handles the user — rather than visual design. Accepts an optional scope; otherwise reviews the full project.

# /uxreview

One of Spruce's signature commands. While `/survey` reviews all seven dimensions, `/uxreview` focuses exclusively on the UX substrate — the layer that determines whether an interface actually works for the person using it, regardless of how it looks.

This command exists because UX is consistently the layer that AI-generated interfaces get wrong while visual design gets the attention. An interface can look polished and still fail at every UX fundamental: navigation that mirrors internal structure instead of user tasks, feedback that's missing or unclear, forms that interrogate instead of guide, empty states that abandon new users, errors that describe failures instead of fixes. `/uxreview` surfaces these failures without being distracted by how the interface looks.

`/uxreview` does not modify code. It produces findings.

---

## When to Use This Command

Use `/uxreview` when:

- The user wants UX-specific analysis, not full-system review.
- The visual design is generally solid but something feels wrong about how the interface works.
- The user is preparing to ship and wants to verify UX fundamentals are in place.
- The interface has grown through feature accumulation and needs a usability check.
- The user says "is this usable," "will people understand this," "what's confusing about this," or similar UX-framed questions.

Do not use `/uxreview` when:

- The user wants comprehensive review across visual and UX dimensions (use `/survey`).
- The user wants opinionated design-director feedback on feel and character (use `/critique`).
- The user wants visual polish, not UX improvements (use `/typeface`, `/colorgrade`, `/arrange`, `/refine`, or `/pace`).
- The user wants copy-specific review (use `/voice`).

### What /uxreview covers

`/uxreview` reviews structure, flow, and behavior — the UX Decision Patterns reference file. Specifically:

- Information architecture and navigation
- System feedback and state communication
- Forms and guided input
- Empty states, errors, and recovery
- Attention and cognitive load
- Progressive disclosure
- First impressions and conversion flow
- Interaction contracts and state completeness
- Trust and transparency

### What /uxreview does not cover

`/uxreview` does not review copy (voice, error message wording, button labels — use `/voice`), visual treatment of UX components (button styling, form input appearance — use `/refine`), or motion and animation (use `/pace`). A finding may observe that an error state exists; a separate `/voice` run would address whether the error message itself is well-written.

This discipline keeps `/uxreview` focused. When a finding genuinely crosses domains, note it but stay scoped: "Error states are missing across the checkout flow (UX). The specific copy for these states should be addressed separately with `/voice` once the states exist."

### Relationship to /audit

`/uxreview` and `/audit` (the Discovery tier's HCD-grounded evaluation command) both flag state coverage gaps but frame them differently. `/uxreview` frames findings against general UX principles ("every list needs an empty state"); `/audit` frames them against specific user impact ("this empty state fails [persona] doing [job] because…"). When both have been run on the same scope, `/audit` can reference `/uxreview`'s state-coverage findings rather than re-evaluating them — `/audit`'s distinct value is the HCD-grounded findings only it can surface (behavioral anti-patterns, persona-specific failures, journey-gap analysis). Run `/uxreview` for substrate-discipline review; run `/audit` when the project has `.personas.md` + `.jtbd.md` and you want findings tied to named users + jobs.

---

## Scope Handling

`/uxreview` accepts an optional scope argument to focus the review:

- `/uxreview` — reviews the full project.
- `/uxreview checkout-flow` — reviews just the specified flow.
- `/uxreview settings` — reviews just the settings surface.
- `/uxreview onboarding` — reviews just the onboarding experience.

When no scope is provided, default to full project review. When scope is provided, focus on that area while considering how it integrates with surrounding flows.

If the scope is ambiguous, ask one clarifying question before proceeding.

---

## The Review Process

`/uxreview` runs through the UX Decision Patterns reference and performs a dedicated state completeness audit. Both are required for every review.

### 1. Read the context

Read the `.spruce.md` context file if it exists. Context calibrates the review — expert users need different feedback than novice users, task-intensive products have different UX priorities than browsing-oriented products.

### 2. Run through the UX dimensions

For each dimension in the UX Decision Patterns reference, evaluate the scope under review:

**Information architecture and navigation.** Do navigation labels describe user tasks or internal product structure? Is wayfinding consistent at every level? Does navigation depth stay within reasonable bounds?

**System feedback and state communication.** Does every action produce immediate perceptible response? Are loading states designed rather than placeholder? Is system status legible at a glance?

**Forms and guided input.** Do forms feel like conversations or interrogations? Does validation guide or punish? Are required/optional fields marked correctly?

**Empty states, errors, and recovery.** Does every list, table, dashboard, and container have a designed empty state? Do error messages describe fixes rather than failures? Do failure states have immediate recovery paths?

**Attention and cognitive load.** Is there a clear primary action on each screen? Is complexity revealed in layers? Are users asked to make too many simultaneous decisions?

**Progressive disclosure.** Is complexity organized by frequency of use? Are advanced features available but not dominant?

**First impressions and conversion flow.** (If applicable — marketing contexts, landing pages, signup flows.) Does the first screen answer what-is-this/who-is-it-for/why-should-I-care? Is the conversion path a series of earned commitments?

**Interaction contracts.** Do interactive elements have complete state treatments? Do hover, active, and focus states exist and feel connected?

**Trust and transparency.** Are destructive actions explained before committing? Are data collection and permissions explained at the point of request? Do multi-step flows show progress?

### 3. Run the state completeness check

This is a mandatory dedicated pass. For every interactive component and data-dependent surface in the scope, verify:

**For interactive components** (buttons, inputs, toggles, selects, links, etc.):
- Default state
- Hover state (if applicable to platform)
- Active/pressed state
- Focus state (keyboard)
- Disabled state
- Loading state (for components that trigger async work)

**For data-dependent surfaces** (lists, tables, dashboards, content areas):
- Populated state
- Empty state (never-populated)
- Empty state (filter or search produced no results)
- Loading state
- Error state
- Partial state (some data loaded, some failed, if applicable)

**For form surfaces:**
- Idle state
- Focused field states
- Validation error states
- Submitting state
- Success state
- Submission error state

Missing states are findings. The state completeness check exists because this is consistently the layer where AI-generated interfaces fail silently — the happy path looks polished and everything else is missing.

### 4. Note systemic patterns

If the same issue appears repeatedly across the scope (every list is missing an empty state, every form uses validation-on-submit instead of on-blur, every destructive action uses primary button styling), report it as a systemic finding rather than as individual instance findings. A systemic finding is more useful than a catalog.

---

## Severity Classification

Same four tiers as `/survey`, calibrated to UX:

**P0 — Critical.** UX failures that leave users unable to complete tasks, stranded in broken states, or actively misled. Missing error handling that loses data. Destructive defaults on irreversible actions. Forms that discard user input on validation failure. Accessibility-blocking UX failures.

**P1 — Significant.** UX failures that meaningfully reduce usability: missing loading states, undesigned empty states, weak navigation active states, feedback that only appears as auto-dismissing toasts, missing state completeness across common components.

**P2 — Polish.** UX details that affect quality without breaking function: validation timing that could be improved, progress indicators that could be more specific, minor feedback inconsistencies.

**P3 — Opportunity.** Places where the UX could go further — guided onboarding that would help new users, contextual help that would ease learning, progressive disclosure that would reduce initial complexity.

Calibrate severity to context. A missing loading state on a critical flow is P0; the same missing state on a rarely-used admin screen might be P1.

---

## Output Format

The output follows the same structure as `/survey` but filtered to UX concerns.

### 1. Review header

One paragraph describing the scope and overall UX impression. Summary line: "Found [N] UX issues: [X] P0, [Y] P1, [Z] P2, [W] P3."

If the state completeness check found significant gaps, call this out in the header: "The state completeness check found [N] missing states across interactive components and data surfaces — these are the most significant issues found."

### 2. Critical issues (P0)

If any exist, they come first. Format identical to `/survey`:

> **[Finding name]** (Area: [UX dimension])
>
> [One-to-two-sentence description of the issue and why it matters for the user.]
>
> *Fix:* [One-sentence suggestion, with command when applicable.]

### 3. Significant issues (P1)

Grouped by UX dimension. Use headers for dimensions that have findings; skip dimensions that don't.

Dimensions, in recommended order when multiple apply:
- Information architecture and navigation
- System feedback and state
- Forms and input
- Empty states and errors
- State completeness (its own section, given its importance)
- Cognitive load and progressive disclosure
- Interaction contracts
- Trust and transparency

The **State completeness** section is called out specifically even when the findings are structural — this gives the AI a consistent way to surface the check's findings and makes it clear when state completeness issues are a significant portion of the review.

### 4. Polish issues (P2)

Same grouped structure as P1. Findings can be tighter.

### 5. Opportunities (P3)

Optional. Include only when meaningful UX improvements exist — not filler.

### 6. Recommended next steps

Three to four prioritized actions. Most should point to specific corrective commands — usually `/fortify` for missing states, `/refine` for component UX issues, or inline fixes for specific flows. Some findings may require design decisions that a command can't automate; flag these as "needs design decision" and point the user toward `/decide` if direction-setting is needed.

---

## Fix Suggestions

Same approach as `/survey`. Every finding gets a one-sentence fix suggestion. Map findings to the right commands:

- Missing states → `/fortify`
- Component-level UX issues → `/refine`
- Structural issues requiring design decisions → `/decide` or inline design guidance
- Flow-level issues → often require multiple commands or design work, flag explicitly
- Copy-related fixes → `/voice` (but flag as "address with `/voice` after fixing the structural issue")

---

## Calibration Notes

**Don't over-report state completeness.** If an entire product is missing focus states, report it once as a systemic finding ("Focus states are missing across all interactive components — this is an accessibility failure") rather than as a finding per component.

**Don't confuse UX with visual.** "The button looks generic" is a visual finding and belongs to `/survey` or `/refine`. "The button's disabled state is indistinguishable from its default state" is a UX finding — the user can't tell whether they can act on it.

**Don't inflate findings.** An interface with clean IA, good feedback, and complete states should get a short review. Don't pad to look thorough. A brief, confident "UX fundamentals are solid here. Minor polish items below." is legitimate output.

**Do calibrate to product type.** A professional tool used daily has different UX priorities than a consumer app used weekly. A dense data dashboard shouldn't be flagged for cognitive load the way a consumer landing page would be. Context shapes what counts as a problem.

**Do note when UX issues have visual or copy causes.** Some UX failures manifest as visual or copy problems (a "Submit" button is a UX issue because the label doesn't describe the action; a low-contrast disabled state is both UX and visual). Note these crossovers briefly and point to the right corrective command.

---

## Tone

Same as `/survey`: direct, useful, not harsh, confident, proportionate. For `/uxreview` specifically, ground findings in user impact — "users encountering this state will not know whether their action registered" is stronger than "this state lacks feedback." The user-impact framing keeps findings concrete and prevents abstract UX criticism.

---

## Edge Cases

**When the scope is UX-solid:** Say so. "The UX fundamentals in this scope are in good shape. Findings below are polish items." A short positive review is legitimate.

**When state completeness is entirely missing:** This becomes the lead finding, and the recommended action is typically to address states systematically before other polish. "The most significant UX issue in this scope is state incompleteness across the interface. Before addressing specific flows or polish, run `/fortify` to establish state handling. Then re-review."

**When a finding requires visual redesign:** Note it as UX with a visual component. "The primary action on this screen is visually indistinguishable from secondary actions — users don't know what they should click. This is a visual hierarchy problem with UX consequences. Address with `/refine` and `/arrange` together."

**When the user asks about a specific UX concern (not a full review):** Treat it as a focused `/uxreview` on that concern. Don't force the full review structure on a narrow question.

---

## Example Interaction (Abbreviated)

**User:** `/uxreview settings`

**Spruce:**

Reviewed the settings surface focused on UX fundamentals. The information architecture is reasonable, but state completeness is the significant issue — several surfaces render empty containers or missing feedback. Also some flow issues around destructive actions and confirmation.

Found 9 UX issues: 1 P0, 4 P1, 3 P2, 1 P3.

**Critical issues (P0)**

> **Account deletion confirmation has destructive action as default** (Area: Trust and transparency)
>
> The "Delete account permanently" confirmation dialog has the destructive button styled as primary with "Delete" as the default action. This makes accidental irreversible action easy.
>
> *Fix:* Require deliberate selection for irreversible destruction — typing the account name, or at minimum styling the destructive button as secondary with cancel as default. Run `/refine` to apply consistently.

**Significant issues (P1)**

> **State completeness**
>
> **Profile avatar upload has no loading or error state**
> When a user uploads a new avatar, the existing avatar remains visible during upload with no progress indication. On failure, no error state is shown — the avatar simply doesn't change.
> *Fix:* Add loading state (skeleton or spinner overlay) during upload and specific error state on failure. Run `/fortify`.
>
> **Settings list items lack hover states**
> Setting rows are clearly interactive (clicking navigates to sub-settings) but provide no hover affordance, leaving users unsure what's clickable.
> *Fix:* Add hover state to all setting list items. Run `/refine`.

> **Forms and input**
>
> **Password change form validates only on submit**
> Users don't learn their new password fails requirements until after clicking Save, forcing them to re-engage with already-filled fields.
> *Fix:* Validate password requirements on blur with progressive feedback for each requirement as typed.

> **Empty states and errors**
>
> **Billing history empty state is generic "No records found"**
> New users with no billing history see a null-check message rather than an explanation of what this area shows or how it gets populated.
> *Fix:* Design empty state explaining what billing history will show ("Your invoices and payment records will appear here after your first billing cycle"). Run `/fortify`.

*[... rest of findings ...]*

**Recommended next steps:**

1. Fix the critical confirmation default before shipping — account deletion with a destructive default is a serious risk. Run `/refine`.
2. Address state completeness issues next — these are the most systemic UX failures in the scope. Run `/fortify`.
3. Adjust password validation timing and design the billing empty state — these are smaller but high-impact UX improvements.

*This command is part of Spruce. `/uxreview` exists because the UX substrate is where AI-generated interfaces most consistently fail, and Spruce treats it as first-class rather than as a layer of polish on top of visual design.*
