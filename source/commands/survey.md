name: survey
description: Comprehensive design and quality review across all seven Spruce dimensions. Produces a structured report of findings organized by severity, with each finding grouped by domain and paired with a brief fix suggestion. Accepts an optional scope to focus the review on a specific area; otherwise reviews the full project. Use when you want to understand what's working, what isn't, and what to prioritize before making changes.

# /survey

The diagnostic workhorse. Where `/design` generates new work and `/decide` directs new decisions, `/survey` inspects existing work — reviewing an interface across all seven Spruce dimensions and producing a structured report of what's working, what isn't, and what to prioritize.

`/survey` doesn't modify code. It produces findings. The user decides which findings to act on, usually by invoking the corrective commands that address specific domains.

---

## When to Use This Command

Use `/survey` when:

- The user wants a comprehensive understanding of an interface's current state before making changes.
- A codebase, page, or feature has grown organically and the user wants to see what accumulated issues exist.
- The user is preparing to ship and wants a final quality pass identification.
- Work was inherited or carried across team changes and needs assessment.
- The user says "what's wrong with this," "review this," "tell me what needs work," or similar broad diagnostic requests.

Do not use `/survey` when:

- The user wants UX-specific review, not full-system review (use `/uxreview`).
- The user wants opinionated design-director feedback rather than structured findings (use `/critique`).
- The user wants fast anti-pattern detection without full analysis (use `/detect`).
- The user wants HCD-grounded findings tied to named personas + jobs (use `/audit`).
- The user wants to fix something, not find what to fix (use the corrective commands).
- The user has already identified the problem and just wants it corrected.

### Relationship to /audit

`/survey` and `/audit` both produce structured severity-tiered findings, but the lens differs. `/survey` evaluates against dimensional principles (typography, color, spatial, component, motion, voice, UX). `/audit` evaluates against HCD artifacts (`.personas.md` + `.jtbd.md`, plus `.journeys.md` and `.scenarios.md` when present). `/survey` works without HCD artifacts; `/audit` requires them. Run `/survey` for comprehensive dimensional review; run `/audit` for HCD-grounded evaluation tied to specific user impact. Findings can overlap (a single issue might be flagged by both lenses), but the framings are distinct and complementary.

---

## Scope Handling

`/survey` accepts an optional scope argument to focus the review:

- `/survey` — reviews the full project (all pages, components, surfaces accessible).
- `/survey checkout-flow` — reviews just the specified area.
- `/survey dashboard` — reviews just the dashboard components and views.
- `/survey src/components/forms` — reviews a specific directory.

When no scope is provided, default to a full project review. When scope is provided, focus the review on that area while still considering how it relates to the broader project (for example, a checkout flow's consistency with the rest of the product).

If the scope is ambiguous ("survey the product" when multiple interpretations exist), ask one clarifying question before proceeding. Don't guess and produce findings on the wrong surface.

---

## The Review Process

The review runs across all seven Spruce reference domains. For each domain, look for:

1. **Violations of established principles** — content that contradicts the reasoning in the reference files.
2. **Named anti-patterns** — specific failures identified in each reference file's anti-pattern section.
3. **Missing work** — gaps where something that should exist doesn't (missing states, missing error handling, missing empty states, etc.).
4. **Coherence failures** — inconsistencies within the project that reveal a lack of system-level decisions.
5. **Context mismatches** — places where the design's character contradicts what the context file describes.

### The seven domains

For each domain, consult the corresponding reference file:

- **UX Decision Patterns** — information architecture, feedback and state communication, forms, empty states and error recovery, cognitive load, progressive disclosure, first impressions, interaction contracts, trust.
- **Typography** — typeface selection, type system and hierarchy, measure and leading, craft details (quotes, tabular figures, letter-spacing), font pairing.
- **Color & Contrast** — palette construction, neutrals tinting, accent strategy, contrast ratios, dark mode as a parallel system, semantic color usage.
- **Spatial Design** — spacing scale adherence, proximity and relationship, rhythm, density calibration, grid discipline, negative space.
- **Component Patterns** — layout archetype, component anatomy, state completeness, system coherence, specific component category usage.
- **Motion & Interaction** — motion purpose, timing and easing, micro-interactions, state transitions, scroll behavior, motion accessibility.
- **UX Writing** — voice consistency, button labels, form copy, error messages, empty state copy, confirmation language, destructive action copy.

### The context layer

Before any domain review, read the `.spruce.md` context file if it exists. The findings should be calibrated to the product's character — what counts as a problem depends on what the product is trying to be. A dense dashboard shouldn't be flagged for insufficient whitespace; a premium consumer product should be.

If no context file exists, note this in the survey. Some findings require context to evaluate ("is this dense enough?") and should be reported as "needs context to evaluate" rather than assumed.

---

## Severity Classification

Every finding is assigned a severity level. Use these four tiers:

**P0 — Critical.** Actively harmful issues: accessibility failures, broken states, content that's unusable, copy that's wrong or misleading, missing error handling that would leave users stranded. These must be fixed before shipping.

**P1 — Significant.** Issues that meaningfully reduce the product's quality: generic character (Inter everywhere, purple gradients, generic voice), weak hierarchy, missing states beyond the happy path, substantial inconsistency across the product. These should be fixed before shipping if possible.

**P2 — Polish.** Issues that affect craft and character but don't break the experience: craft details like straight quotes instead of smart quotes, slight spacing inconsistencies, motion timing that could be better, minor copy that could be more specific. These can be addressed as time allows.

**P3 — Opportunity.** Not problems exactly — places where the design could go further or express more character. Optional improvements. Include these only when they're meaningful, not as filler.

The severity of a finding depends on context. A missing focus state is P0 on an accessibility-critical product and P1 on an internal tool. A generic button label is P1 on a consumer product where voice matters and P2 on a utility. Calibrate to the specific situation.

---

## Output Format

The output follows a consistent structure so users can scan for what matters and dig into what they need.

### 1. Survey header

One short paragraph describing the scope of the review and the overall impression. This is where you briefly characterize the state of the work — "this is a solid foundation with specific issues in three areas" versus "this product has significant character and coherence problems that need addressing before specific fixes make sense."

Then a summary line: "Found [N] issues: [X] P0, [Y] P1, [Z] P2, [W] P3."

### 2. Critical issues (P0)

If any P0 issues exist, they come first. For each:

> **[Finding name]** (Domain: [which reference])
>
> [One-to-two-sentence description of the issue and why it matters.]
>
> *Fix:* [One-sentence suggestion, ending with the command to run if applicable.]

Example:
> **Missing focus states on interactive elements** (Domain: Component Patterns)
>
> Buttons and form inputs lose focus indication when clicked, leaving keyboard users unable to track their position. This is an accessibility failure.
>
> *Fix:* Add focus ring treatment to all interactive components. Run `/refine` to address this systematically.

If no P0 issues exist, note that briefly: "No critical issues found."

### 3. Significant issues (P1)

Grouped by domain. Within each domain, list findings with the same format as P0. Use domain headers:

> **Typography**
>
> **[Finding name]**
> [Description.]
> *Fix:* [Suggestion], e.g., run `/typeface`.
>
> **[Finding name]**
> ...

> **Color**
>
> **[Finding name]**
> ...

Only include domain headers that have findings. Don't list empty domain sections.

### 4. Polish issues (P2)

Same structure as P1 — domain headers with findings. P2 issues can be grouped more tightly since individual craft items don't need as much explanation.

### 5. Opportunities (P3)

Optional section. Only include if genuinely meaningful opportunities exist. A single "Opportunity" finding that would meaningfully lift the product is more valuable than five minor could-dos.

### 6. Recommended next steps

A short closing section suggesting what to do first. This is not a replay of the findings — it's a prioritized action plan. Typically:

> **Recommended next steps:**
>
> 1. [The first thing to address and why] — run `/[command]` to address.
> 2. [The second thing] — run `/[command]`.
> 3. [The third thing] — run `/[command]`.

Limit to three or four. If there are more things to address, group them: "After these, consider running `/typeface` and `/voice` for remaining polish."

---

## The Fix Suggestions

Every finding includes a one-sentence fix suggestion. These are actionable, not aspirational. Each suggestion should either:

- Describe the specific fix ("Replace Inter with a typeface that matches the editorial character — consider a modern serif like Tiempos or Source Serif")
- Point to the command that would address it ("Run `/typeface` to apply type discipline systematically")
- Both ("Replace Inter with a deliberately chosen typeface; `/typeface` can handle this")

The suggestion should not be a paragraph. If a fix requires more explanation, the user can invoke the corrective command and get richer guidance there.

### Mapping findings to commands

When pointing findings to commands, use this mapping:

- Typography findings → `/typeface`
- Color findings → `/colorgrade`
- Spacing/layout findings → `/arrange`
- Component-level findings → `/refine`
- Motion findings → `/pace`
- UX writing findings → `/voice`
- UX substrate findings (IA, feedback, errors, empty states) → `/fortify` for missing states, or address specific issues inline
- Complexity / cardocalypse findings → `/reduce`
- Final polish across everything → `/finish`

Some findings don't map to a single command and should be flagged inline with specific guidance instead.

---

## Calibration Notes

**Don't over-report.** A survey with 40 findings is overwhelming and useless. A survey with 8 well-chosen findings is actionable. Aim for the most significant issues per severity tier, not every possible issue. For large projects with many issues, surface representative examples of systemic problems rather than listing every instance ("Inter is used across the product" rather than listing every component that uses Inter).

**Don't pad P3 to look thorough.** If the work is solid and P3 is short, let it be short. Filler findings degrade the survey's credibility.

**Don't report opinions as findings.** "This could use more whitespace" is an opinion without context. "The spacing scale is inconsistent — body text uses 16px gaps in some sections and 22px in others, violating the 4px-base spacing system" is a finding. Keep findings grounded in specific, verifiable observations.

**Do calibrate to context.** A premium consumer app with aggressive spacing is a P1 finding for that product context. The same spacing on an information-dense dashboard might be appropriate. Context matters.

**Do notice systemic problems.** If the same issue appears throughout (Inter everywhere, missing focus states across all buttons, generic voice in every error message), report it as a systemic finding with one fix suggestion rather than as multiple instance-level findings.

---

## Tone

- **Direct and useful.** Users invoke `/survey` to get clear information, not a performance of thoroughness. Get to findings quickly and state them plainly.
- **Not harsh.** Findings describe problems, not failures. "The type hierarchy is weak — body text and subheadings are only 2px apart" is useful; "The typography is bad" is not.
- **Confident.** You're applying established reasoning from the reference files. Don't hedge every finding with "this might be an issue." If it's a finding, say so.
- **Proportionate.** Match the weight of language to the severity. P0 issues deserve direct language about consequences. P3 opportunities can be stated lightly.

---

## Edge Cases

**When the project is genuinely well-designed:** Say so. "This product is in strong shape. The issues below are polish items rather than significant problems." A short, positive survey is legitimate output.

**When the scope has no issues in a domain:** Don't create findings to fill space. If typography is clean, say nothing about typography.

**When findings contradict each other:** They shouldn't, in a well-run survey. If you find yourself flagging "insufficient density" in one finding and "cramped spacing" in another, you're either surveying inconsistently or the scope has genuinely inconsistent density and the finding should be "inconsistent density across [specific sections]."

**When the user hasn't set up a context file:** Note it once at the top. Proceed with the review, flagging findings that require context to evaluate appropriately.

**When findings depend on user preference:** Some design choices are legitimate either direction. If a finding might be contested — "the motion is quite fast at 100ms for major transitions" — frame it neutrally with both interpretations: "This reads as crisp and confident but may feel rushed to users coming from slower-paced products."

## Example Interaction (Abbreviated)

**User:** `/survey dashboard`

**Spruce:**

Reviewed the dashboard across all seven Spruce dimensions. The foundation is solid — clean component structure, reasonable spacing system — but there are character and coherence issues that are dulling the work, plus some gaps in state completeness that need attention before shipping.

Found 11 issues: 2 P0, 5 P1, 3 P2, 1 P3.

**Critical issues (P0)**

> **Missing loading states for async data** (Domain: UX Decision Patterns)
>
> Chart widgets and data tables render empty rectangles during data fetch, producing layout shift and confusion about whether the page is working.
>
> *Fix:* Add skeleton screens matching the shape of each data widget. Run `/fortify` to handle this across the dashboard.

> **Destructive actions use primary button styling** (Domain: Component Patterns)
>
> The "Delete project" confirmation uses the same blue primary-button style as safe actions, making accidental deletion easy.
>
> *Fix:* Style destructive buttons with warning color and require deliberate selection (cancel as default). Run `/refine` to apply systematically.

**Significant issues (P1)**

> **Typography**
>
> **Inter used throughout despite technical product character**
> Your context file describes the product as precision-oriented, but Inter is the statistical default with no active character. A more deliberate typeface would express the intended voice.
> *Fix:* Consider IBM Plex Sans, Söhne, or a technical monospace for data contexts. Run `/typeface`.
>
> **Tabular figures not enabled for data values**
> Numeric data in tables misaligns vertically, making comparison difficult.
> *Fix:* Enable `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` on table cells and metric displays.

> **Color**
>
> **Accent color overused across dashboard chrome**
> The accent color appears in sidebar dividers, card borders, and decorative icons, diluting its ability to direct attention to primary actions.
> *Fix:* Reserve accent color for primary CTAs, active states, and key metrics. Use neutrals for structural elements. Run `/colorgrade`.

*[... rest of P1, P2, P3 findings ...]*

**Recommended next steps:**

1. Address P0 findings first — missing loading states and destructive button styling are ship blockers. Run `/fortify` then `/refine`.
2. Tackle typography and voice character issues — they're what makes this feel generic right now. Run `/typeface` and `/voice`.
3. Final pass with `/finish` once character is established and state completeness is addressed.

*This command is part of Spruce. `/survey` is the diagnostic workhorse — comprehensive but calibrated, structured but readable, and always pointed toward what to do next rather than just what's wrong.*
