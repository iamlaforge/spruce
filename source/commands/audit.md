name: audit
description: Run an HCD-grounded heuristic evaluation of an existing product against the named personas + jobs + journeys + scenarios. Produces a structured findings report tied to specific personas and jobs, with severity weighting and recommended correctives. Distinct from /survey (dimensional review across all 7 dimensions), /uxreview (UX substrate audit), /critique (design-director narrative), and /detect (anti-pattern scan) — /audit is the HCD lens. Requires .personas.md and .jtbd.md as prerequisites; uses .journeys.md and .scenarios.md when present for richer findings. Does not modify code; produces findings the corrective tier addresses.

# /audit

The HCD-grounded evaluation command. `/audit` is the fifth command in Spruce's Discovery tier — and the only diagnostic command in the tier (the others produce HCD artifacts; this one uses them). It evaluates an existing product against the named personas + jobs (and journeys + scenarios when available) to surface where the product serves real users well, where it fails them, and what to address.

The audit is what makes the upstream HCD work pay off. Personas, jobs, journeys, and scenarios establish what the product should serve; the audit reveals where the actual product matches that foundation and where it doesn't. From there, the corrective tier has somewhere real to anchor.

`/audit` is distinct from the other diagnostic commands:
- **`/survey`** — dimensional review (typography, color, spatial, etc.).
- **`/uxreview`** — UX substrate audit (state coverage, IA, forms).
- **`/critique`** — design-director narrative on character + coherence.
- **`/detect`** — fast anti-pattern scan.
- **`/audit`** — HCD-grounded: does this serve named users doing named jobs?

The lenses are complementary; running multiple produces a complete diagnostic picture.

`/audit` does not modify code. It produces findings; the corrective tier addresses them.

## When to Use This Command

Use `/audit` when:

- The product has `.personas.md` and `.jtbd.md` in place and you want to evaluate against real users + jobs.
- A product is being inherited and you want to ground assessment in HCD context rather than dimensional principles alone.
- The team has been making design decisions on intuition and wants explicit findings tied to specific user impact.
- A specific surface or flow needs evaluation (the audit can be scoped) and you want findings framed as "this fails persona X doing job Y."
- You're preparing for a major redesign and want the HCD-grounded picture before designing.

Do not use `/audit` when:

- `.personas.md` or `.jtbd.md` doesn't exist — run `/personas` and `/jtbd` first. Without these, the audit collapses into `/uxreview` or `/survey`.
- You want fixes applied, not findings produced. Use the corrective commands.
- You want dimensional review (use `/survey`), UX substrate review (use `/uxreview`), narrative design-director read (use `/critique`), or fast anti-pattern scan (use `/detect`).
- The product is too early to audit — there's no shipped surface to evaluate.

## Detecting Existing Files

At the start, check for the prerequisites:

**If `.personas.md` doesn't exist:** stop and recommend `/personas` first.

**If `.jtbd.md` doesn't exist:** stop and recommend `/jtbd` first.

> The audit evaluates the product against named personas + jobs. Without `.personas.md` and `.jtbd.md`, the audit would collapse into a generic dimensional review — which `/survey`, `/uxreview`, `/critique`, and `/detect` already cover. Recommend running `/personas` and `/jtbd` first; the audit is what makes those artifacts pay off.

**If both prerequisites exist:** check for the optional richer artifacts.

> Also reading: `.journeys.md` ([N] journeys present / not yet mapped). `.scenarios.md` ([N] scenarios present / not yet mapped).
>
> The audit will use whatever's available. Personas + jobs alone produces the foundational pass; journeys add journey-gap analysis; scenarios add specific-moment testing. More artifacts → more specific findings.

---

## Scope Handling

`/audit` accepts an optional scope argument:

- `/audit` — full product audit across every available surface.
- `/audit [page or flow]` — focused audit on one surface or one flow.

For most projects, scoped audits produce more actionable findings than full-product ones. A whole-product audit produces broad findings that get deprioritized; a scoped audit produces sharp findings the team can address. Recommend scoping unless the team explicitly wants a comprehensive picture.

If the user invokes `/audit` without scope, ask:

> Want to audit the full product, or scope to a specific surface or flow? Scoped audits tend to produce more actionable findings — recommend scoping to the area where current design decisions are pending.

## The Evaluation Pass Methodology

The audit follows a structured pass through the available HCD artifacts. Five passes:

### Pass 1: Walk the product against each persona's primary jobs

For each persona in `.personas.md`:
- For each primary job in `.jtbd.md`:
  - Walk through the product flow that should serve this job.
  - Where does the product serve the job? Where does it fail?
  - Surface findings tied to the specific persona + job + surface.

This is the foundational pass. Every audit produces findings here.

### Pass 2: If `.journeys.md` exists, walk the mapped journeys

For each journey:
- Walk the product through the touchpoints the journey describes.
- Where does the actual product match the journey? Where does it diverge?
- Note: divergences are findings (either the product or the journey is wrong).

### Pass 3: If `.scenarios.md` exists, test against specific scenarios

For each scenario:
- Imagine the design encountered in the scenario's specific moment.
- Does the design hold up under the scenario's attention level, surrounding context, time pressure?
- Surface findings about specific moments where the design fails the scenario.

### Pass 4: Cross-persona check

Look across all the findings:
- Findings affecting multiple personas → usually highest-priority.
- Findings affecting only the primary persona → high-priority.
- Findings affecting only secondary personas → medium-priority.
- Findings where serving one persona's job actively works against another's → surface as `/decide` tradeoffs.

### Pass 5: Positive findings

Surface 2-3 specific things the product does well in serving the personas + jobs. Audits that surface only failures read as adversarial and undervalue the work. Positive findings ground the negative ones in real evaluation.

## The Findings Format

Each finding is structured:

**[Finding name — short descriptive label]**

- **Where:** specific surface, flow, or touchpoint.
- **What:** what's happening at this surface that fails (or succeeds).
- **Affects:** the persona(s) + job(s) the finding is tied to. By name + ID where possible.
- **Severity:** [Blocking / Significant / Friction / Polish] — calibrated to impact on primary persona's primary jobs.
- **Confidence:** derived from the confidence of the HCD artifacts the finding draws on (research-grounded / context-derived / assumed).
- **Recommended corrective:** which Spruce command would address it. `/voice`, `/typeface`, `/refine`, `/decide`, etc.
- **Behavioral anti-pattern (when applicable):** if the finding fits a named behavioral anti-pattern (Choice Overload, Premature Commitment, Cognitive Tax, Missing Recovery, Engagement Trap, Persona Mismatch), name it.

### Severity calibration

- **Blocking** — the finding prevents the primary persona from completing a primary job. Address before shipping.
- **Significant** — the finding meaningfully degrades the experience for the primary persona or blocks a secondary persona's primary job. Address in the next iteration.
- **Friction** — the finding adds avoidable friction without blocking. Address when convenient.
- **Polish** — the finding is a small refinement that would improve the experience without affecting any persona's job completion. Address in `/finish` or defer.

Severity calibrates to *impact*, not to *fixability*. A small finding that blocks the primary persona's primary job is Blocking even if it's cheap to fix.

## The Audit Report Structure

The output is a structured report:

### 1. Frame

One paragraph naming the scope, the artifacts read (with confidence tiers), and the high-level shape of the findings (e.g., "5 blocking, 8 significant, 12 friction, 4 polish, plus 3 positive findings").

### 2. Positive findings

2-4 specific things the product does well in serving the personas + jobs. Brief; grounded in named personas + jobs.

### 3. Findings by severity

Group findings by severity, highest first. Within each severity group, order by which persona is affected (primary's findings first).

### 4. Cross-persona summary

If the audit surfaced cross-persona patterns (findings affecting multiple personas, conflicts between personas' needs), surface them in a brief summary.

### 5. Recommended next steps

Brief — 3-5 specific moves. Usually some combination of:
- "Run `/voice` first — most blocking findings are voice-related."
- "Run `/decide` on the [specific tradeoff] surfaced in Pass 4."
- "Update `.personas.md` to reflect [refinement] surfaced during the audit."
- "Re-run `/audit` after the corrective tier passes; expect [N] of these to clear."

### 6. Closing

> Happy to:
> - Drill into any finding for more context.
> - Run a specific corrective on the highest-priority findings.
> - Re-audit after corrective work to verify findings are addressed.

## What Not to Do

**Don't run without prerequisites.** `.personas.md` and `.jtbd.md` are required. Inventing personas during the audit produces findings against fictional users. Stop and recommend the prerequisites if they don't exist.

**Don't produce only failures.** The Adversarial Audit is a real anti-pattern. Include 2-3 positive findings — what the product does well in serving the personas + jobs.

**Don't produce findings without persona + job attribution.** Every finding should name which persona + job it affects. "The empty state is uninformative" is generic; "the empty state on the practices grid fails Jordan doing F1 because it offers no orientation context" is HCD-grounded.

**Don't produce findings without recommended correctives.** Every finding closes with a Spruce corrective command. The team can override; at least there's a starting point.

**Don't try to evaluate the entire product in one pass for large projects.** Whole-product audits produce broad findings that get deprioritized. Scope by surface or flow; run multiple smaller audits.

**Don't disguise context-derived confidence as research-grounded.** Findings inherit the confidence of the artifacts they're grounded in. If the personas are context-derived, the findings against them are context-derived. Flag honestly.

**Don't conflate `/audit` with the other diagnostic commands.** The other commands evaluate against dimensional principles; `/audit` evaluates against HCD artifacts. If the user wants typography findings, run `/survey`; if they want HCD-grounded findings, run `/audit`.

---

## Tone

- **Honest about confidence.** Findings inherit the confidence of the underlying HCD artifacts. Be explicit about it.
- **Honest about severity.** Calibrate to user impact, not to fixability or convenience.
- **Specific in finding language.** Tied to specific personas + jobs + surfaces. Generic findings are a fail.
- **Constructive.** Audit reports are read by people who built the product; the goal is to help the work get better, not to perform critique.

---

## Edge Cases

**When `.personas.md` is thin or stale.** Audit against stale personas produces findings against users who may no longer be representative. Surface this. "Personas were last updated [N months ago] and may not reflect current users. Recommend re-running `/personas` before treating findings as definitive — or proceed with the audit understanding the findings carry the personas' staleness."

**When the audit surfaces a finding the personas can't explain.** Sometimes the product is doing something that doesn't serve any named persona's named job. The finding is real, but the framing can't be persona-grounded. Surface as: "This finding doesn't tie to any current persona — it may be serving an unnamed user type, or it may be unjustified. Recommend either updating `.personas.md` to capture the user type or considering whether the surface should be removed."

**When journey-gap analysis surfaces product-ahead-of-journey gaps.** The product supports touchpoints the journey doesn't capture. Surface as: "Product has evolved past the journey; recommend re-running `/journey` to update."

**When journey-gap analysis surfaces product-behind-journey gaps.** The journey assumes touchpoints the product doesn't support. Surface as: "Product is behind the journey at touchpoint [N]. Either the journey was aspirational and the product hasn't caught up (build it), or the journey was wrong (revise it)."

**When the audit reveals the product is serving the wrong persona.** Sometimes the surface in question is genuinely well-designed but for a different audience than the named primary persona. This is a Persona Mismatch behavioral anti-pattern. Surface as a high-priority finding even if dimensional review would call the surface "good."

**When the user asks for an audit on a product that's still in design.** Recommend `/critique` or `/uxreview` instead. `/audit` is for evaluating shipped or near-shipped surfaces; pre-shipped design work is better served by the design-time diagnostic commands.

## Example Interaction (Abbreviated)

**User:** `/audit`

**Spruce:** Found `.personas.md` (Maya, Jordan), `.jtbd.md` (6 jobs), `.journeys.md` (Maya's morning practice — current + future state), `.scenarios.md` (Maya morning kitchen + Jordan first-time curious). All four artifact types available — full HCD-grounded audit possible.

> Want to audit the full product or scope to a specific surface or flow? Scoped audits tend to produce more actionable findings — recommend scoping to the area where current design decisions are pending.

**User:** Scope to the home page first-impression and first-practice flow.

**Spruce:** Got it. Scoped to: home page → personalization banner → practice detail page → practice begins. Walking through each persona's primary jobs against this flow, then journey + scenario passes.

[*runs the five-pass evaluation, surfaces findings tied to personas + jobs, weights by severity, includes positive findings, closes with recommended next steps*]

*This command is the fifth and final command in Spruce's Discovery tier. `/audit` produces HCD-grounded findings the corrective tier addresses; it's the lens that makes the upstream HCD work pay off.*
