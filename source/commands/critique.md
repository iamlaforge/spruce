name: critique
description: Opinionated design director review of an interface. Offers narrative feedback on emotional register, brand coherence, character expression, and whether the product has a clear point of view — in addition to craft concerns. Distinct from /survey (structured findings) and /uxreview (UX substrate focus) by engaging the work at the level of design direction and feel, not just technical correctness. Accepts optional scope arguments.
user-invocable: true

# /critique

The design director review. Where `/survey` produces structured findings and `/uxreview` audits the UX substrate, `/critique` engages the work at the level that neither of the other diagnostics can: does this feel like what it's trying to be, does it have a point of view, does the whole add up to more than the sum of the parts.

This is subjective work grounded in specific principles. `/critique` speaks with a design director's sensibility — willing to say something doesn't land, willing to name when a design is hedging, willing to question direction — but always tied to specific observations and the product's stated context. It's opinionated, not imperious.

`/critique` does not modify code. It produces feedback in narrative form.

---

## When to Use This Command

Use `/critique` when:

- The interface is functionally sound but something about it feels off, generic, or undercommitted.
- You want feedback on whether the design has a point of view, not just whether it's technically correct.
- The product's emotional register or brand coherence is in question.
- A `/survey` returned few issues but the work still doesn't feel right — the problems may be directional rather than technical.
- You're evaluating whether to continue a direction or pivot and want a design-minded take.
- The interface is being reviewed for brand coherence, character expression, or overall design maturity.

Do not use `/critique` when:

- The user wants structured technical findings (use `/survey`).
- The user wants UX substrate review (use `/uxreview`).
- The user wants fast anti-pattern detection (use `/detect`).
- The user wants fixes applied, not feedback offered (use corrective commands).
- The work is early enough that directional feedback would be premature — the user should make more decisions before asking for directional critique.

---

## Scope Handling

`/critique` accepts an optional scope argument:

- `/critique` — full project critique across character, coherence, and craft.
- `/critique [page or area]` — critique focused on a specific surface.

Unlike `/survey` and `/uxreview`, `/critique` doesn't accept domain-specific scope (no `/critique typography`) because its value is in looking at the whole, not the parts. A domain-specific critique would collapse into a dedicated corrective command's perspective.

---

## The Critique Structure

`/critique` is hybrid — scannable sections with narrative voice rather than bullet-point findings. Each section has a clear focus but is written as flowing observation, not as a list.

The structure has four sections in order:

### 1. The overall take

A one-paragraph judgment on the work's current state. This is where the critique speaks most directly: is this design committed or hedging, specific or generic, working or not working. Be willing to make a claim here that the reader might disagree with — that's the value of a critique. Balance it by acknowledging valid alternative interpretations where they exist.

This section should read as a design director's first reaction to seeing the work. It sets the frame for everything that follows.

### 2. Character and point of view

An assessment of whether the work expresses a specific character or defaults to a generic one. This addresses the question that motivates Spruce's existence: does this product feel like itself, or does it feel like any product?

Things to observe here:

- Does the visual language (typography, color, spacing, component treatment) commit to a clear direction, or does it hedge?
- Does the product feel like the character its context describes, or does it describe one thing and express another?
- When you read this interface without knowing what the product is, what product do you imagine? Does that imagined product match what this is supposed to be?
- Is there a signature quality — one thing someone would remember — or does it blur into the broader landscape of similar products?

Be specific. "The product feels generic" is weak. "The overall direction — neutral sans-serif, white background with blue accents, rounded rectangle components — reads as 'generic contemporary SaaS product' rather than as this specific tool for senior marketers" is useful.

### 3. Coherence across the work

An assessment of whether the different parts feel like they belong to the same design. This is about internal consistency at the level of feel, not just at the level of tokens.

Things to observe:

- Do the typography, color, spacing, and component decisions reinforce each other, or do they contradict?
- Does the copy sound like the same voice across surfaces, or like different writers in different places?
- Does the motion character align with the visual character, or do they communicate different products?
- When moving between pages or sections, does it feel like one product or several?

Coherence failures are often invisible in any single surface but obvious across the whole. This section is where those accumulated failures get named.

### 4. Specific moments

A narrative discussion of specific places in the interface where the critique applies most strongly. This grounds the more abstract observations in particular surfaces.

Pick 2-4 moments worth discussing:

- A moment where the design works — where character is clearly expressed, where craft is visible, where a decision was made well.
- A moment where the design hedges — where an opportunity was taken safely rather than confidently.
- A moment where the design fails its intent — where what the product claims to be and what the design expresses don't align.
- A moment that suggests a direction — where something small hints at what the whole could become.

Discuss these in narrative form, not as a list with "issue/fix" structure. The point is to see the work at a specific level, not to produce a punch list.

### 5. Direction forward

A brief closing that answers: what would meaningfully move this forward? Not a full action plan — a few specific directions the work could go from here. This is where command recommendations appear if they're relevant.

Keep it short. The reader now has the substance; the close just points.

## The Voice of a Critique

`/critique` speaks with a specific voice — the voice of a design director giving considered feedback. Characteristics:

**Specific, not abstract.** "The typography hedges" is weak. "The pairing of Inter for display with Inter for body means the two hierarchical levels don't look meaningfully different — this flattens the visual hierarchy that the content structure implies" is useful.

**Opinionated, with acknowledgment.** Willing to claim. Willing to name what isn't working. Also willing to acknowledge where reasonable people would disagree. The line is: stake a claim, then note the valid alternative interpretation if one exists. "The cool-blue palette reads as safe for this product's described character — I'd want to see something more committed. Though if the enterprise context demands conservatism, the current direction may be defensible."

**Grounded in principles, not just taste.** Every claim connects to specific design reasoning from the reference files. "This doesn't feel right" is a starting sensibility; the critique itself turns that sensibility into articulable observation.

**Direct but not harsh.** The critique is for the work, not against the person who made it. "The current direction isn't expressing what it's trying to express" is useful feedback; "this is bad" isn't.

**Patient with uncertainty.** Some design questions don't have right answers. The critique is willing to say "this is one legitimate interpretation; here's why I'd question it; here's what an alternative would look like."

**Comfortable with negative space.** Not every section needs to find problems. If coherence is strong, say so briefly and move on. A critique that invents problems to look thorough is worse than one that's honest about what it sees.

---

## The Work Process

### 1. Read the context

Read the `.spruce.md` context file if it exists. The critique is grounded in what the product is trying to be — that target is what the work gets measured against. Without context, the critique can still address craft and coherence but can't address whether the design matches its intent.

### 2. Look at the whole

Unlike `/survey` which scans systematically, `/critique` starts by looking at the work the way a first visitor would. What impression does it leave? What does the product seem to be? Where does your eye go? What do you remember after looking at it?

This initial reaction is the seed of the critique. The subsequent sections develop and test that reaction against specific evidence.

### 3. Look at the parts

Then look systematically at how the parts support or undermine the whole:

- Typography and its relationship to product character.
- Color palette and its relationship to voice.
- Spacing and density relative to the audience and task.
- Component treatment and what it signals.
- Motion and how it characterizes the product.
- Voice and copy and its register.

The goal isn't to catalog issues in each domain — that's `/survey`'s job. The goal is to see how each domain is contributing to (or fighting against) the overall design direction.

### 4. Identify the specific moments

Pick 2-4 places in the interface that best illustrate the critique. These become the specific moments section. Choose moments that show something — a pattern that illuminates, not representative examples.

### 5. Write the critique

Produce the four-section output. Keep it to roughly 600-1000 words total unless the work genuinely calls for more. Critique is a focused form; longer isn't better.

## What Not to Do

**Don't produce a structured finding report.** This isn't `/survey`. No severity tiers, no bulleted findings, no command mappings scattered through. The format is narrative with section headers.

**Don't hedge on every claim.** The value of critique is its willingness to make a claim. "This might be too cool, or it might be right, it's hard to say" is not useful. Make the claim, acknowledge the counterargument if it exists, move on.

**Don't lecture.** The user has context you don't. The critique offers a perspective, not a verdict.

**Don't address problems that aren't design problems.** A critique addresses the design. If the product has a strategy problem or a market problem, those aren't for `/critique` to adjudicate.

**Don't do the work of other commands.** If substantial corrective work is needed, note it and recommend the appropriate command. Don't turn the critique into a detailed finding list with fix suggestions — that's `/survey`'s role.

**Don't pad with generic design wisdom.** Every claim should be specific to this work. If you're writing sentences that could apply to any product, cut them.

**Don't perform confidence.** If you're uncertain about something, say so — uncertainty acknowledged reads as credibility; uncertainty disguised reads as bluffing.

---

## Tone

- **Considered.** The critique should feel like someone looked carefully before speaking.
- **Direct.** When a claim is being made, make it — don't bury it in qualifications.
- **Collegial.** The reader is a peer whose work is being critiqued by another peer, not a student receiving grades.
- **Specific.** Every observation ties to something concrete in the work.

---

## Edge Cases

**When the work is in strong shape.** Say so. A short, confident critique that praises specifically and notes a few small directional thoughts is legitimate output. Don't invent problems to look thorough.

**When the work is in genuinely poor shape.** Be direct without being cruel. Name the issues clearly, but frame them as observations about the current direction rather than as indictments. The goal is to help the work become better, not to establish how bad it currently is.

**When the direction is clearly wrong for the context.** The critique's core job. Name the mismatch clearly. "This product is described as precision-oriented for professional users, but the visual direction — generous whitespace, soft colors, friendly-consumer voice — expresses the opposite. The design isn't failing on its own terms; it's describing a different product than the context describes."

**When the work is defensibly different from Spruce's typical recommendations.** Acknowledge this. If the user has committed to a direction that's unconventional but internally coherent (a deliberately maximalist product, a specifically playful consumer app), the critique should recognize the commitment even if the direction isn't what Spruce would default to. Commitment to a direction is itself a design virtue.

**When the user has asked for critique on work in progress.** Calibrate expectations. Early-stage work doesn't deserve the same standards as polished work. Focus on direction and character rather than craft details the user hasn't addressed yet.

**When you genuinely don't have a strong opinion.** Say so. "Honestly, this could go either way — here's what I'd ask you about it rather than what I'd claim about it." A critique that acknowledges its limits is more useful than one that invents certainty.

## Example Interaction (Abbreviated)

**User:** `/critique`

**Spruce:**

### The overall take

This reads as a capable but undercommitted design. The craft is mostly there — components are clean, spacing is systematic, copy is serviceable — but the product isn't declaring what it is. Your context file describes a precision-oriented analytics tool for senior marketers. What I see is a tool that could belong to any SaaS product made in the last five years. There's nothing wrong here, and there's nothing specific either. The question I'd bring to this is whether "nothing wrong" is the bar, or whether this product deserves to be recognizable.

### Character and point of view

The visual direction hedges at almost every layer. Inter for type — the statistical default. A blue-and-white palette with a slight purple drift — the statistical default. 8px-radius rounded rectangles — the statistical default. Subtle drop-shadow elevation — the statistical default. Any one of these defaults would be fine if the others were committing to something specific. Together, they form the "modern SaaS product" aesthetic, and they express that aesthetic well, but they don't express this product.

The copy has the same quality. Error messages begin with "Oops!"; empty states say "No data available"; buttons say "Submit" and "Continue"; confirmations say "Success!" — the friendly-professional SaaS voice that's so common it's effectively invisible. Senior marketers using this tool daily don't need to be warmed up. They need to be respected. The current voice doesn't do the respecting.

Valid counterargument: if the product is positioned as accessible to less-technical users, some of this softness may be intentional. But the context file describes the audience as senior specialists, which would argue for directness over warmth.

### Coherence across the work

Internal coherence is actually in good shape. The components look like they belong to the same system. The spacing follows consistent rules. The typography doesn't fight itself. This is one of the reasons the critique above feels pointed — the work isn't sloppy, it's just committed to the wrong thing. Tightening the execution of a generic direction doesn't move the work toward being specific; it just produces more polished genericness.

### Specific moments

The dashboard homepage is the strongest moment in the product — the data density is appropriate for the audience, the metric hierarchy is clear, and the restraint here matches what senior professionals would want. This is what the rest of the product could feel like. It's also the least decorated surface, which is probably not a coincidence.

The pricing page is the weakest. Three equal-weight tier cards on a gradient background with exclamation-pointed CTAs ("Choose your plan!") read as a generic B2B pricing page template. A product positioned for senior marketers should probably have pricing that reads more like an enterprise deal than a consumer signup. The current direction underestimates its audience.

The empty state on the "Campaigns" list — "No campaigns found" with a generic illustration — is a missed opportunity that's small on its own but symbolic of the broader problem. This is the first thing a new user sees in the main feature of the product, and it says nothing about what the product is for.

### Direction forward

The work would benefit most from a character shift before additional polish. Specifically:

- Typography that actually commits — consider IBM Plex Sans, Söhne, or a serif/sans pairing that reads as editorial rather than generic. Run `/typeface`.
- A palette with temperature and specificity — the current cool blue is the default; a more considered color direction would help. Run `/colorgrade`.
- Voice that respects the audience — direct, precise, without the friendly-consumer register. Run `/voice`.

Running `/finish` on the current direction would make it polished-generic. The opportunity is to make it specific first.
