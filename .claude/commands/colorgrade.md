name: colorgrade
description: Apply color system discipline to an existing interface. Addresses palette coherence, neutral tinting, accent strategy, contrast ratios, semantic color usage, and dark mode (when present). Actively corrects AI-default color patterns like purple gradients and tech-blue accents unless the user has explicitly directed them. Proposes conversion to OKLCH as an approval request when the project uses older color formats. Accepts optional scope arguments to focus on specific color concerns.

# /colorgrade

The color system corrective command. `/colorgrade` addresses color-specific issues in existing code — applying the reasoning from the Color & Contrast reference file to bring palette coherence, character, and craft to an interface.

Color is where AI-generated interfaces are most recognizable. The purple gradient, the tech-blue accent, the pure black on pure white, the missing neutral tinting — these patterns are so common that they now function as visual watermarks of default output. `/colorgrade` actively works against these defaults while respecting explicit user direction.

---

## When to Use This Command

Use `/colorgrade` when:

- The palette feels generic, defaulted, or has the AI-default color aesthetic.
- The interface uses a purple gradient, tech-blue accent, or similar pattern that wasn't deliberately chosen.
- Pure black (#000) and pure white (#FFF) appear without tinting, producing a flat, lifeless feel.
- Accent color is overused — appearing in too many places without clear reason.
- Contrast is either failing accessibility or sitting exactly at minimums (4.5:1) across the board.
- Dark mode exists but was implemented as a mechanical inversion rather than a parallel system.
- A `/survey` has flagged color issues and the user wants them addressed systematically.

Do not use `/colorgrade` when:

- The user wants an entirely new design generated (use `/design`).
- The user wants to explore alternative palette directions (use `/remix` or `/decide`).
- The issue is typography, spacing, or component-level rather than color (use the appropriate domain command).
- Color is already strong and the work needs a different corrective.

---

## Scope Handling

`/colorgrade` accepts optional scope arguments to focus the work:

- `/colorgrade` — full color pass covering palette, neutrals, accents, contrast, semantics, dark mode (if present).
- `/colorgrade palette` — focuses on the overall palette construction and coherence.
- `/colorgrade neutrals` — focuses on neutral tinting and the base palette structure.
- `/colorgrade accent` — focuses on accent color strategy and usage.
- `/colorgrade contrast` — focuses on text contrast and hierarchy through contrast.
- `/colorgrade semantic` — focuses on semantic colors (success, warning, error, info).
- `/colorgrade dark` — focuses specifically on dark mode (only if dark mode exists in the project).
- `/colorgrade gradients` — focuses on gradient usage and removing AI-default gradient patterns.

When no scope is provided, default to the full pass. When scope is provided, stay focused on that area.

---

## The Autonomy Model

`/colorgrade` uses a smart-default autonomy model: make small improvements directly, surface palette-level shifts for approval before executing.

### What to fix autonomously

These are changes the user would almost certainly want and that don't change the palette's overall direction:

- Tinting pure black and pure white. Replace `#000` with a slightly tinted near-black (warm or cool depending on the palette's overall temperature); replace `#FFF` with a tinted off-white. The tint direction should match the existing palette.
- Fixing contrast failures. Text that falls below WCAG 4.5:1 for body or 3:1 for large should be adjusted to meet minimums — usually by darkening the text color slightly or lightening the background.
- Establishing text color hierarchy. If the project uses a single text color everywhere, introduce primary, secondary, and tertiary text colors following the reference guidance (primary high contrast, secondary around 60-70% of primary's contrast, tertiary lower but still readable).
- Correcting mismatched temperatures. If neutrals are tinted warm but the accent is cool (or vice versa) without deliberate intent, align the accent to the palette's temperature.
- Normalizing semantic colors. If success/warning/error colors have mismatched chroma or lightness, bring them onto a consistent scale.

### What to surface for approval

These changes shift the palette's character and require user direction:

- **Replacing AI-default color patterns.** If the palette uses a purple gradient, tech-blue accent, or similarly defaulted pattern, surface this as a character question. Propose an alternative tied to the product's context and wait for approval before executing.
- **Converting to OKLCH.** If the project uses HEX or HSL, propose conversion with explanation of the benefit (perceptual uniformity, better palette construction). This is a significant change to the codebase and deserves approval.
- **Significant accent hue shifts.** If the current accent is wrong for the context but replacing it would change the product's perceived voice, propose rather than swap silently.
- **Introducing dark mode.** `/colorgrade` does not create dark mode proactively. If dark mode doesn't exist, don't build it — suggest it as a separate task if relevant.

### Honoring explicit user direction

If the user has explicitly directed the use of specific colors — including patterns that would normally be flagged (purple gradients, tech-blue, specific hex values from a brand guide) — respect that direction. The context file may specify "the brand color is #7c3aed," or the user may have directly told you to use a specific palette.

When explicitly-chosen colors would otherwise be flagged:

- Do not replace them without approval.
- Do not propose replacement unprompted.
- Apply all other color discipline (neutrals, contrast, usage patterns) around whatever colors the user has chosen.
- If asked, note that the choice is less common for the product's described character — as context, not correction.

## The Work Process

### 1. Read the context

Read the `.spruce.md` context file if it exists. Color is deeply tied to product character — warm or cool, restrained or expressive, traditional or contemporary. The context calibrates what "good color" means for this specific product.

Note explicit color preferences. Brand colors, specified accents, restricted palettes — all of these are directional input.

### 2. Inspect the current color system

Build an understanding of the current state:

- What's the current color format (HEX, HSL, OKLCH, RGB)?
- Is there a structured palette, or are colors scattered arbitrarily through the code?
- What's the overall temperature — warm, cool, neutral?
- Is pure black or pure white used anywhere?
- What's the accent color, and how prominently is it used?
- Are semantic colors (success, warning, error) defined and consistent?
- Does dark mode exist? If so, how was it constructed — as a parallel system or by inversion?
- What contrast ratios are present for primary, secondary, tertiary text?

This inspection produces the diagnosis that guides the rest of the work.

### 3. Identify AI-default patterns

Specifically look for the high-signal patterns that mark AI-generated color work:

- Purple gradients (hues 270°-290° transitioning to adjacent hues).
- Tech-blue defaults (saturated electric blue around 220°-240°) as the primary accent.
- Pure black text on pure white backgrounds.
- Gray text on colored backgrounds.
- The same drop-shadow-with-subtle-blue treatment used for all elevation.
- Accent color distributed across too many elements (dividers, borders, decorative icons).

If these patterns are present and weren't user-directed, they're candidates for correction. Surface replacement for approval — don't swap silently even when correcting defaults.

### 4. Identify the highest-impact issues

The impact hierarchy for color work:

1. Palette direction — the highest-character-impact decision (overall temperature, accent character).
2. Neutral discipline — tinting pure values, establishing the palette's atmosphere.
3. Contrast and hierarchy — primary/secondary/tertiary text, contrast strategy.
4. Accent strategy — where and how the accent is used.
5. Semantic consistency — health of the semantic color system.
6. Dark mode parity — (if present) whether it's a parallel system.
7. Gradient and transparency discipline — purposeful use vs. decoration.

For a full pass, address all levels. For scoped work, focus on the requested area.

### 5. Apply autonomous fixes

Execute the changes that don't require approval. Group related changes — handle all neutral tinting in one pass, all text hierarchy adjustments in another. This keeps the change report readable.

When darkening or tinting colors, use OKLCH math internally when possible for consistency, even if the output format stays in HEX or HSL. This produces more coherent results than tweaking HEX values by eye.

### 6. Surface palette-level shifts

For AI-default corrections, OKLCH conversion, or other significant changes, propose before executing:

> **Proposed change: Replace AI-default accent**
>
> Currently using: Purple (`#7c3aed`) as primary accent
>
> Proposed: [Specific alternative tied to context, e.g., "A warm terracotta (`oklch(58% 0.14 45)`) that aligns with the humanist character your context describes"]
>
> Reasoning: [One paragraph explaining why the current color reads as AI-default and how the alternative would serve the product's specific character]
>
> This would change the product's primary color signal significantly. Want me to proceed? If you'd prefer a different direction, I can propose alternatives or you can specify a hue you have in mind.

Wait for the user's response before executing. Handle OKLCH conversion as its own proposal when relevant.

### 7. Generate the output

**A brief summary.** One or two sentences describing what was done.

**The actual changes.** Code diffs or modified files. Focus on what changed.

**Change notes.** Bulleted list of significant changes, each with a one-sentence reason.

> **Changes made:**
>
> - Replaced pure black text (`#000`) with a warm near-black (`oklch(18% 0.008 60)`) to align with the palette's overall temperature.
> - Established three-tier text color hierarchy: primary at 12:1 contrast, secondary at 8:1, tertiary at 5:1 — previously all text used a single color.
> - Aligned semantic colors (success, warning, error) to a consistent chroma range (0.12-0.16) — previously they had mismatched saturation.
> - Reduced accent color usage — removed it from card dividers and decorative icons; retained for primary CTAs and active navigation states.
>
> **Surfaced for approval:**
>
> - Current accent is a tech-blue (`#3b82f6`) used as the default "modern SaaS" color. Proposed replacing with [specific alternative tied to context]. See proposal above.

**A brief closing.** "Happy to adjust anything. Run `/explain color` to walk through the reasoning, or `/remix color` to see alternative palette directions."

## What Not to Do

**Don't silently swap AI-default colors.** Even when a purple gradient or tech-blue accent is clearly the wrong choice for the product's character, the replacement is a character decision. Propose and wait.

**Don't convert to OKLCH without approval.** The benefit is real (perceptual uniformity, better palette construction), but converting an entire codebase's color format is a significant change. Propose it, explain the benefit, let the user decide.

**Don't create dark mode that doesn't exist.** `/colorgrade` works on what's in the project. Building dark mode where there wasn't one is a new design task, not a correction.

**Don't apply tinting without temperature awareness.** If you're tinting pure black, make the tint match the palette's temperature — warm palette gets warm near-black, cool palette gets cool near-black. Don't pick a tint direction arbitrarily.

**Don't fight explicit user direction.** If the brand color is a purple gradient and the user has specified it, respect that. Apply other color discipline around it.

**Don't generate colors for unspecified areas.** `/colorgrade` is a corrective command. It improves the color of what's there — it doesn't design new surfaces or components.

## Tone

- **Confident.** You're applying established reasoning from the Color & Contrast reference. State changes plainly.
- **Specific in reporting.** OKLCH values where relevant; exact contrast ratios when they matter. Precise reporting builds trust.
- **Respectful of direction.** When surfacing proposals, frame them as options with reasoning, not as corrections of errors. The user's choice governs.

---

## Edge Cases

**When the project has no structured palette.** Build one. Establish backgrounds, surfaces, text levels, border levels, and accent treatment. Report this as significant work — you're establishing discipline where none existed.

**When colors are consistent but use an AI-default pattern.** The consistency is good; the direction is wrong. Surface the direction issue as an approval request rather than fixing it silently. "Color usage is internally consistent, but the palette itself reads as AI-default (purple gradient + gray neutrals). Want me to propose an alternative direction, or preserve the current palette?"

**When fixing contrast would change character.** Meeting contrast minimums usually requires small adjustments that don't change character. But sometimes a design relies on low-contrast subtlety that's accessibility-problematic. Surface this: "The tertiary metadata at 3.2:1 contrast is below accessibility minimums. Want me to darken to meet 4.5:1 — this will make the metadata slightly more prominent — or find another way to maintain the subtle hierarchy?"

**When dark mode is present but broken.** Fix it as part of the work. If dark mode was built as a mechanical inversion (pure black background, pure white text, same accent colors as light mode), restructure it as a parallel system — tinted dark background, text that tops at 92-96% lightness, accent colors adjusted for dark surfaces. Flag this as significant work.

**When the scope is tight (`/colorgrade contrast`) but other issues are severe.** Complete the scoped work, then briefly note the adjacent issues. "Contrast is now compliant. Worth noting: the accent color is a tech-blue default — running `/colorgrade accent` would address that."

## Example Interaction (Abbreviated)

**User:** `/colorgrade`

**Spruce:**

Applied color discipline across the project. Most changes were direct — text hierarchy, neutral tinting, semantic color consistency, accent usage. Two palette-level shifts are surfaced for your review.

*[Code changes showing specific edits to color-related files]*

> **Changes made:**
>
> - Replaced pure black text (`#000`) with a warm near-black (`oklch(18% 0.008 60)`) to align with the palette's warm direction.
> - Replaced pure white backgrounds (`#FFF`) with tinted off-white (`oklch(98% 0.005 80)`) for a softer, more designed feel.
> - Established three-tier text color hierarchy: primary, secondary (~68% contrast of primary), tertiary (~45%).
> - Fixed tertiary metadata contrast — was at 3.2:1, now at 5.1:1 to pass accessibility while remaining visibly subordinate.
> - Aligned semantic colors to consistent chroma (0.13-0.15). Success, warning, error now feel like one family.
> - Reduced accent color usage — removed from card borders, section dividers, decorative icons. Retained for primary CTAs, active nav states, focus rings, and interactive highlights.
> - Aligned hover and active state darkening to consistent rules (4% lightness shift on hover, 7% on active).
>
> **Surfaced for approval:**
>
> **Proposed: Replace AI-default accent**
>
> Currently using: Tech-blue (`#3b82f6`) as primary accent.
>
> Proposed: A deep green (`oklch(48% 0.13 150)`) that aligns with the natural, grounded character your context file describes for this wellness product.
>
> Reasoning: The current accent is the statistical default for "modern SaaS product" and reads as generic rather than specific to your product's character. A deep green would express the natural, approachable voice directly, and the hue territory (130°-150°) is currently underused in AI-generated design, which helps the product feel distinctive. If you'd prefer a warmer direction, a muted terracotta or ochre would also fit the character.
>
> Want me to proceed with the green? Propose alternatives if you'd prefer a different direction, or specify a hue you have in mind.
>
> **Proposed: Convert to OKLCH**
>
> The project currently uses HEX throughout. I'd recommend converting to OKLCH for the palette because it's perceptually uniform — equal numerical steps produce equal perceived steps, which makes palette construction and consistency easier.
>
> This would change how colors are specified throughout the codebase (a significant diff) but shouldn't change any rendered color. I'd preserve the current visual output while making the underlying format more useful for future work.
>
> Want me to proceed with the conversion, or keep HEX?
