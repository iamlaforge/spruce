name: detect
description: Fast anti-pattern scan across all seven Spruce dimensions. Identifies specific named anti-patterns from the reference files plus clear accessibility failures, with each finding pointing to the corrective command that would address it. Designed to be quick and actionable — not a comprehensive review like /survey, not a narrative critique like /critique. Use for a rapid check of what's wrong before deciding what to fix.
user-invocable: true

# /detect

The fast anti-pattern scanner. `/detect` runs through the anti-pattern catalogs in each Spruce reference file plus a short accessibility checklist, flags every match with its location, and points to the corrective command that would fix it. No severity, no analysis — match, locate, route.

This is the lightest of the diagnostic commands. The output is optimized for speed of decision — seeing what's wrong and knowing what to run next.

---

## When to Use This Command

Use `/detect` when:

- You want a quick scan for specific anti-patterns without a full review.
- You've heard "there's probably some AI slop in here" and want to know what specifically.
- You're triaging — deciding whether any corrective work is needed before committing to a full review.
- You want a fast check before a `/finish` pass.
- A quick sanity check during active development.

Do not use `/detect` when:

- You want comprehensive findings with severity and action plans (use `/survey`).
- You want design-direction feedback on feel and character (use `/critique`).
- You want UX-substrate review specifically (use `/uxreview`).
- You want HCD-grounded findings tied to named personas + jobs (use `/audit`).
- You want to fix problems rather than find them (use corrective commands).

### Relationship to /audit

`/detect` scans against the dimensional anti-pattern catalogs — named UI anti-patterns from each reference file (the SaaS CTA, the three-equal-cards layout, the friendly-professional voice, etc.). `/audit` surfaces behavioral anti-patterns grounded in named personas + jobs (Choice Overload, Premature Commitment, Cognitive Tax, Engagement Trap, Persona Mismatch). UI anti-patterns and behavioral anti-patterns are different categories — both can be present in the same surface. `/detect` is fast and binary; `/audit` is structured and grounded in HCD artifacts. Run `/detect` for fast triage; run `/audit` when the project has personas + jobs and you want findings the UI-pattern catalog can't surface.

---

## Scope Handling

`/detect` accepts an optional scope argument:

- `/detect` — scans the full project.
- `/detect [page or area]` — scans a specific surface.
- `/detect [file path]` — scans a specific file.

When no scope is provided, default to full project scan. Keep the scan fast regardless of scope — the command's value is speed.

---

## What /detect Scans For

`/detect` scans for two categories of findings:

### Named anti-patterns from reference files

The reference files each contain a named anti-pattern section at the end. `/detect` scans for these specifically:

### Clear accessibility failures

Beyond named anti-patterns, flag clear accessibility blockers:

- `outline: none` without a replacement focus treatment.
- Text below WCAG 4.5:1 contrast for body text or 3:1 for large text.
- Icon-only buttons without `aria-label` or equivalent accessible name.
- Color alone used to communicate information (status indicators with no icon or text).
- Keyboard-inaccessible interactive elements (onclick handlers on divs without keyboard support).
- Form errors not programmatically associated with their fields.
- Missing `prefers-reduced-motion` handling on significant animations.

These are findings even if they don't match a named anti-pattern, because they affect users who are using the product right now.

## Output Format

The output is optimized for speed — grouped by domain, minimal framing, each finding as a single line where possible.

### 1. One-line frame

Open with a single line summarizing the scan result: "Scanned [scope]. Found [N] anti-patterns across [X] domains." If nothing was found: "Scanned [scope]. No anti-patterns detected."

### 2. Findings by domain

Group findings under domain headers. Skip domains that have no findings — don't print empty sections.

Within each domain, list findings with:
- Anti-pattern name in bold.
- Brief description (one short sentence).
- Location (file, component, or section).
- Corrective command pointer.

Format:

> **Typography**
>
> - **The Inter Reflex** — Inter used as primary typeface throughout. Locations: `src/styles/base.css`, `components/*`. Run `/typeface`.
> - **The Straight Quote** — Straight quotes (`"`) in prose across 6 files. Run `/typeface craft`.
> - **The Proportional Number Misalignment** — Tabular figures not enabled on data tables. Locations: `components/DataTable.tsx`, `pages/dashboard.tsx`. Run `/typeface craft`.

Keep the descriptions very short — the anti-pattern names are the signal, descriptions are just enough to confirm the match. If the user wants more detail, they can run `/survey` or consult the reference file.

### 3. Systemic patterns note

If any anti-pattern appears broadly across the project (rather than in specific locations), note it distinctly:

> **Systemic:**
>
> - **The Friendly Professional** — generic SaaS voice throughout product copy. Affects: errors, empty states, buttons, confirmations. Run `/voice`.

Systemic findings matter more than location-specific ones because the fix is broader.

### 4. Accessibility section

If accessibility blockers were found, they get their own section — surfaced clearly because they affect users right now:

> **Accessibility blockers:**
>
> - Missing focus treatment on 12 interactive elements (`outline: none` without replacement). Run `/fortify accessibility`.
> - Text contrast below 4.5:1 on metadata in 3 locations. Run `/fortify accessibility`.
> - Icon-only close buttons without `aria-label` in modal component. Run `/fortify accessibility`.

### 5. Quick summary

Close with a single line identifying the highest-leverage command to run next. Based on what was found, name the one command that would address the most or the most significant findings:

> **Highest-leverage next step:** Run `/voice` first — the systemic generic voice affects the most user-facing copy.

Or if multiple commands are clearly needed:

> **Start with:** `/fortify accessibility` (blockers), then `/typeface` (systemic), then `/colorgrade` for the remaining findings.

Keep this close to one or two lines. The user now knows what's wrong and what to run — they don't need elaborate guidance.

---

## What Not to Do

**Don't analyze.** `/detect` identifies and points. Analysis belongs to `/survey` and `/critique`.

**Don't suggest fixes beyond command pointers.** "Run `/voice`" is enough. Don't launch into how `/voice` would address the finding — the user can check the command's documentation or run it to see.

**Don't produce severity ratings.** `/survey` handles severity. `/detect` is binary — the anti-pattern is present or it isn't.

**Don't pad the output.** If three anti-patterns were found, the report should be short. Don't invent findings or add minor issues to look thorough.

**Don't miss systemic patterns.** If the same anti-pattern appears throughout the project, flag it once as systemic rather than listing every instance. Systemic findings are more actionable than instance lists.

**Don't include findings that depend on context the user hasn't provided.** If the context file doesn't exist and an anti-pattern depends on context to evaluate (for example, whether the current density is appropriate for the product character), flag that it requires context rather than asserting a finding without basis.

**Don't turn this into `/survey`.** If the scan suggests a comprehensive review would be useful, say so and recommend `/survey`. Don't expand the scope of the detection to fill in.

---

## Tone

- **Fast.** The output should feel like a quick check, not a report.
- **Direct.** Findings are named and located without elaboration.
- **Useful.** Every finding should connect to an action the user can take.

---

## Edge Cases

**When nothing is found.** A clean result is a legitimate finding. "Scanned the project. No anti-patterns detected in any domain and no accessibility blockers identified. If something still feels off, run `/critique` for design-direction feedback that's not captured by named anti-patterns."

**When the findings are minimal.** A short output is a good output. Three findings across two domains is a quick, useful detection — don't pad it to feel substantive.

**When the findings overwhelm.** If 40+ anti-patterns are detected, something systemic is wrong. Don't dump the full list. Group findings by what's systemic versus what's instance-level, and recommend `/survey` for a structured comprehensive review that will scale better than `/detect` at that volume.

**When an anti-pattern is borderline.** Some findings depend on interpretation — a single Inter usage might not be "The Inter Reflex" if the context supports it, a card wrapping content might or might not be cardocalypse depending on purpose. When borderline, flag only if you're confident it's a match. Lean toward missing rather than false-positive.

**When accessibility and anti-pattern findings overlap.** Some accessibility failures also match named anti-patterns (missing focus states could be both "accessibility blocker" and "Missing State"). Pick the framing that makes the most actionable finding — usually the accessibility framing because the urgency is clearer.

**When the user has context that would explain away a finding.** If the context file or project shows the user has deliberately chosen something that would normally be an anti-pattern (Inter as a brand requirement, purple as a specific brand color), don't flag it. Respect user direction.

## Example Interaction (Abbreviated)

**User:** `/detect`

**Spruce:**

Scanned the project. Found 14 anti-patterns across 5 domains, plus 3 accessibility blockers.

**Typography**

- **The Inter Reflex** — Inter used as primary typeface throughout. Systemic across all text. Run `/typeface`.
- **The Straight Quote** — Straight quotes in prose across 8 files. Run `/typeface craft`.
- **The Proportional Number Misalignment** — Tabular figures not enabled on data tables. Locations: `components/DataTable.tsx`, `pages/billing.tsx`. Run `/typeface craft`.

**Color**

- **The Tech-Blue Default** — Generic electric blue (`#3b82f6`) as primary accent. Run `/colorgrade accent`.
- **The Pure Black and Pure White** — Pure `#000` text on `#FFF` background in multiple locations. Run `/colorgrade neutrals`.
- **The Accent Everywhere** — Accent color used on dividers, borders, decorative icons across project. Run `/colorgrade accent`.

**Spatial Design**

- **The Symmetric Heading** — Headings use symmetric top/bottom margins in 6 components. Run `/arrange rhythm`.
- **The Equal Column** — Features section uses 3-equal-column layout for unequal content. Location: `pages/home.tsx`. Consider `/refine` or `/design` for restructuring.

**Component Patterns**

- **The Universal Rounded Rectangle** — 8px border radius used across all components. Run `/refine shape`.
- **The Cardocalypse** — Cards wrap content that doesn't need containment in settings page (8 instances), dashboard (4 instances). Run `/reduce cards`.
- **The Missing State** — 14 interactive components lack hover or focus states. Run `/fortify` or `/refine states`.

**UX Writing**

**Systemic:**

- **The Friendly Professional** — Generic SaaS voice throughout. Affects error messages, empty states, button labels, confirmations. Run `/voice`.

**Instance:**

- **The Generic Button** — 18 buttons use "Submit", "Continue", "Learn More", "OK", "Done". Run `/voice buttons`.
- **The Oops Reflex** — 6 error messages begin with "Oops!". Run `/voice errors`.

**Accessibility blockers:**

- Missing focus treatment on 12 interactive elements (`outline: none` without replacement). Run `/fortify accessibility`.
- Text contrast below 4.5:1 on tertiary metadata in `components/MetaRow.tsx`. Run `/fortify accessibility`.
- Icon-only close buttons without `aria-label` in modal components. Run `/fortify accessibility`.

**Highest-leverage next step:** Run `/fortify accessibility` first to address the blockers. Then `/voice` — the systemic generic voice affects the most user-facing copy. Then `/typeface` for the Inter situation and craft fixes.

*This command is part of Spruce. `/detect` is a fast triage scan — named anti-pattern detection plus accessibility blockers, pointing directly to the commands that would address each finding. Designed for speed, not analysis.*
