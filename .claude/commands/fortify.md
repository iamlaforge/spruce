name: fortify
description: Apply production readiness to an existing interface. Builds missing states (empty, loading, error, success, disabled), addresses accessibility comprehensively (focus, keyboard navigation, ARIA, contrast), and surfaces responsive behavior issues for separate work. Builds states with reasonable context-calibrated copy; user can run /voice to refine. Handles structural and interactive work autonomously; surfaces architectural decisions for approval. Accepts optional scope arguments.

# /fortify

The production readiness corrective command. `/fortify` addresses the gaps that separate an interface from being genuinely ready to ship — the missing states, the accessibility failures, the edge cases where the happy path was implemented and everything else was left undone.

State completeness is where AI-generated interfaces most consistently fail. The default state is polished; loading, empty, error, disabled, and success states are absent or stubbed. Accessibility is treated as an afterthought. `/fortify` exists because a component isn't done when its happy path looks right — it's done when every path a user might encounter has been designed and built.

---

## When to Use This Command

Use `/fortify` when:

- The interface handles the happy path well but lacks states for what happens when data is missing, loading, or failing.
- Empty states, loading states, and error states are inconsistent or absent across the project.
- Accessibility work has been neglected — focus states missing, keyboard navigation incomplete, ARIA attributes absent, contrast failures.
- The user is preparing to ship and wants to address production readiness systematically.
- A `/survey` or `/uxreview` has flagged state completeness or accessibility as significant issues.

Do not use `/fortify` when:

- The interface is missing fundamental design decisions, not just states (use `/design`).
- The user wants to explore alternative state treatments creatively (use `/decide` or `/remix`).
- The issue is visual polish rather than state and accessibility gaps (use `/finish`).
- States and accessibility are already solid and the work needs a different corrective.

---

## Scope Handling

`/fortify` accepts optional scope arguments to focus the work:

- `/fortify` — full production readiness pass covering states, accessibility, and edge cases.
- `/fortify states` — focuses on state completeness (loading, empty, error, success, disabled).
- `/fortify empty` — focuses on empty state design.
- `/fortify loading` — focuses on loading state design.
- `/fortify errors` — focuses on error state design.
- `/fortify accessibility` — focuses on keyboard navigation, focus states, ARIA, and contrast.
- `/fortify [file or area]` — focuses on production readiness within a specific area.

When no scope is provided, default to the full pass. When scope is provided, stay focused on that area.

---

## The Autonomy Model

`/fortify` uses the standard smart-default autonomy model, calibrated for state-building work.

### What to build autonomously

These are additions that any production-ready interface needs and that don't require character decisions:

- **Loading states.** For any surface loading data asynchronously — lists, tables, dashboards, cards with dynamic content — add skeleton screens that match the shape of the expected content. For component-level loading (button clicks that trigger async work), add in-button spinner or progress indication.
- **Empty states (first-use).** For any list, table, or content container that could be empty for a new user — design a three-part empty state: explanation of the space, reason for emptiness, and a specific action to populate. Use context-calibrated copy (e.g., for a project management tool: "Your projects will appear here. Start one to begin tracking work.").
- **Empty states (filter/search).** For any filterable or searchable surface — design a distinct empty state that acknowledges what was searched and offers alternatives (clear filter, try different terms, view all).
- **Error states.** For any surface that can fail to load — design error states with what-happened and what-to-do-now language. "Couldn't load [content]. Check your connection and try again." Add retry affordance where retry is sensible.
- **Success confirmations.** For significant actions (form submissions, destructive confirmations, major state changes) — add specific success confirmation rather than silent success or generic toasts.
- **Disabled state treatment.** For any interactive component that can become disabled — apply consistent disabled styling (45% opacity, removed interaction states, `cursor: not-allowed`, `aria-disabled`).
- **Focus states.** For every interactive element — add visible focus rings (accent color at 2px with appropriate offset). `outline: none` without replacement is corrected to proper focus treatment.
- **Keyboard navigation.** Ensure tab order follows logical reading order. Add skip-to-main-content links on pages with substantial navigation. Modals trap focus appropriately.
- **ARIA attributes.** Add required ARIA where semantic HTML isn't sufficient — `aria-label` on icon-only buttons, `aria-describedby` for form error associations, `aria-live` regions for dynamic content updates, `aria-expanded` for disclosure patterns.
- **Contrast fixes.** Where text falls below WCAG minimums (4.5:1 body, 3:1 large), adjust text or background to meet requirements. Primary content should exceed minimums significantly.

### What to surface for approval

These changes shift the interface's behavior or character:

- **Major architectural state decisions.** If a data-heavy dashboard has no loading strategy at all and adding one requires choosing between progressive rendering, skeleton screens, spinners, or optimistic updates — surface the architectural choice rather than imposing one.
- **Error recovery patterns.** If errors require choosing between retry patterns (automatic retry with exponential backoff, manual retry only, "try again later" with time estimate, contact support flow), surface the decision.
- **Onboarding state flows.** If first-use empty states reveal the need for a substantial first-run experience — product tour, guided setup, starter content — flag this as design work rather than building a full onboarding autonomously.
- **Progressive disclosure decisions.** If addressing cognitive load gaps requires restructuring what's shown when (revealing advanced settings, collapsing infrequently-used features), surface the decision.

### What to flag but not fix

These are issues outside `/fortify`'s scope:

- **Responsive layout issues.** Broken mobile layouts, components that wrap awkwardly at certain viewports, touch targets that are too small, horizontal scroll issues — flag these for `/arrange` or `/design`. `/fortify` addresses states and accessibility, not responsive restructuring.
- **Missing fundamental design.** If a component doesn't have a real default state (let alone missing states beyond it), that's a design gap, not a production readiness gap. Flag for `/design`.
- **Content architecture issues.** If empty states reveal that entire flows are missing ("users have no way to create a project" type gaps), that's product work, not state work.

### Honoring explicit user direction

If the user has specified state behaviors or accessibility approaches in their context file or direction — specific loading pattern preferences, brand-specific empty state illustrations, custom focus treatments — respect that direction. Apply other state and accessibility discipline around their choices.

---

## The Work Process

### 1. Read the context

Read the `.spruce.md` context file if it exists. Context calibrates the state copy, the error tone, the empty state character. An enterprise financial tool and a consumer wellness app need different copy even for the same empty states.

Note explicit preferences — specified loading patterns, error handling conventions, accessibility requirements.

### 2. Inventory state gaps

Systematically identify what's missing across the interface:

- **For every list, table, and dashboard surface:** Does it have populated, empty (never-populated), empty (filter/search), loading, and error states?
- **For every form:** Does it have idle, submitting, success, and submission error states? Are fields handled inline (validation, focus, error display)?
- **For every interactive component:** Does it have default, hover, active, focus, disabled, loading (if applicable), and success/error (if applicable) states?
- **For every async operation:** Is there loading indication, success confirmation, and error handling with recovery?

This inventory drives the rest of the work.

### 3. Audit accessibility

Systematically check accessibility:

- **Focus states.** Every interactive element has a visible focus treatment.
- **Keyboard navigation.** Tab order is logical; all interactive elements are keyboard-reachable; modals trap focus; skip links exist where needed.
- **ARIA.** Icon-only buttons have labels; form errors are programmatically associated with fields; dynamic content regions have appropriate live regions; disclosure patterns have correct state attributes.
- **Contrast.** Text meets WCAG minimums; interactive elements have sufficient contrast with their surroundings; state changes (focus, error, success) are perceivable.
- **Semantic HTML.** Headings are properly nested; form elements use correct semantics; landmarks are used appropriately.
- **Reduced motion.** `prefers-reduced-motion` is respected (handoff to `/pace` if motion work is needed beyond basic handling).

### 4. Identify the highest-impact gaps

The impact hierarchy for production readiness work:

1. Accessibility blockers — failures that prevent users from completing tasks (missing focus states, inaccessible modals, contrast failures on primary content).
2. Missing loading states on async surfaces — produces apparent broken-ness.
3. Missing empty states — strands new users.
4. Missing error states — leaves users with no recovery path.
5. Missing disabled state treatment — creates false affordances.
6. Missing success confirmations — creates uncertainty after significant actions.
7. ARIA and semantic gaps — affects assistive technology users.

For a full pass, address all levels systematically. For scoped work, focus on the requested area.

### 5. Build missing states

For each missing state, build it in place. Use context-calibrated copy for any user-facing text — reasonable defaults the user can refine later with `/voice`. Don't leave placeholder copy like "TODO" or "Empty state message here" — that's not fortified, that's stubbed.

When building state structure:

- Match the visual treatment of the existing interface. Empty states should feel like they belong to the product, not generic illustrations bolted on.
- Use the typography, color, and spacing systems already in place.
- Keep state components consistent across the product. If one empty state uses a specific structure, apply the same structure to others unless a specific variation is warranted.
- Handle the three-part empty state pattern consistently: what this area is, why it's empty now, specific next action.

### 6. Apply accessibility fixes

Add focus states, ARIA attributes, contrast corrections, and keyboard navigation improvements. Test that keyboard users can complete key flows; test that screen reader semantics make sense.

### 7. Surface architectural decisions

For changes that require user direction, propose before executing:

> **Proposed change: Error recovery pattern**
>
> The dashboard has several data-loading surfaces without error handling. Before building error states, I want to confirm the recovery pattern.
>
> Options:
> - Manual retry only — clear "try again" button, user controls when retry happens.
> - Automatic retry with fallback — one automatic retry, then manual button if still failing.
> - Clear failure with support contact — treat load failures as needing support intervention.
>
> Your context file doesn't specify a preference. Which pattern fits your product? If it varies by surface (critical data vs. nice-to-have), I can apply different patterns — let me know.

Wait for approval before executing.

### 8. Flag responsive and architectural issues

Note responsive and other out-of-scope issues in a separate section:

> **Flagged for separate work:**
>
> - Responsive: The navigation sidebar collapses awkwardly between 768px and 1024px (neither full sidebar nor mobile pattern). Run `/arrange responsive` or `/design` to address.
> - Missing fundamental feature: The settings page has no "delete account" flow at all, not just missing states. This is a product gap, not a state gap — building requires design and product decisions.

**A brief closing.** "Happy to adjust anything. The state copy uses reasonable defaults calibrated to your context — run `/voice` to refine it specifically. Run `/explain` to walk through the reasoning."

---

## What Not to Do

**Don't leave stubbed states.** If you're building an empty state, build it with real copy and visual treatment. Placeholder "Empty state" text is not fortification.

**Don't overbuild where context is unclear.** If the user hasn't specified how errors should recover or what onboarding should look like, surface the decision rather than imposing one.

**Don't confuse production readiness with design completeness.** A component missing states needs `/fortify`. A component missing its fundamental design needs `/design`. Don't blur these boundaries.

**Don't redesign responsive behavior.** Flag responsive issues and move on. Restructuring layouts for different viewports is layout work.

**Don't create placeholder illustrations.** If empty states need illustrations to feel complete, note that illustration is needed as a content requirement rather than using a generic or auto-generated placeholder.

**Don't add ARIA where semantic HTML works.** Proper semantic HTML (`<button>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<dialog>`) often doesn't need ARIA. Add ARIA only where semantics alone aren't sufficient.

**Don't fight explicit user direction.** If the user has specified their loading pattern, error handling approach, or accessibility requirements, respect them.

---

## Tone

- **Thorough.** Production readiness benefits from systematic work. Report shows states built, gaps filled, accessibility addressed.
- **Specific.** Report exactly what was built — "Added empty state for projects list" beats "improved empty state handling."
- **Calibrated.** The state copy built should match the product's voice. Note that further refinement with `/voice` is possible.

---

## Edge Cases

**When the interface has some states but they're inconsistent.** If some lists have empty states and others don't, or empty states across the project use different structures, normalize to a consistent pattern. Pick the best existing pattern (or establish a new one based on the UX Writing reference) and apply systematically.

**When state work requires content that isn't available.** Some empty states need illustrations; some error states need specific support contact information; some success states need confirmation codes or next-step details. When content is needed but not available, note this as a content requirement: "Built the empty state structure; content requires an illustration and specific example text that should be provided. Placeholder text is in place and flagged for replacement."

**When fixing accessibility cascades into visual changes.** Focus states add visible elements; corrected contrast may shift text colors; added ARIA sometimes requires slight component restructuring. Surface the cascade when it's significant: "Adding visible focus rings will add accent color to every interactive element on focus — this is a visual change as well as an accessibility fix. If this conflicts with your visual system, we can coordinate with `/colorgrade` on the focus color."

**When the project is genuinely production-ready.** Say so. "The project handles states consistently and accessibility is in good shape. A few minor improvements noted below, but there's nothing systemic that needs addressing before shipping."

**When the scope is tight (`/fortify empty`) but other issues are severe.** Complete the scoped work, then briefly note adjacent issues.

## Example Interaction (Abbreviated)

**User:** `/fortify`

**Spruce:**

Applied production readiness across the project. Most work was direct — building missing states, adding accessibility treatments, fixing contrast and ARIA gaps. One architectural decision is surfaced for your review, and I've flagged responsive and structural issues for separate work.

*[Code changes showing specific additions and fixes]*

> **Changes made:**
>
> **States built:**
> - Added skeleton-screen loading states for 14 data surfaces: dashboards, project lists, team member grids, activity feeds, search results.
> - Designed empty states for 9 surfaces. Each uses three-part structure. Example, projects list: "Projects will appear here as you create them. Start a project to track work and invite your team." Copy is calibrated to your precision-oriented context; run `/voice` to refine tone further.
> - Designed filter/search empty states distinct from first-use. Example: "No projects match 'Q3'. Clear the filter or try broader terms."
> - Designed error states for async surfaces with retry button. Example: "Couldn't load projects. Check your connection and try again."
> - Added submission success confirmations for 5 major forms. Each confirms what was saved and notes what happens next.
> - Added disabled state treatment across 34 interactive components — consistent 45% opacity with removed interaction states.
>
> **Accessibility fixes:**
> - Added visible focus treatment (2px accent ring, 1px offset) to 52 interactive elements. Previously `outline: none` without replacement.
> - Added `aria-label` to 21 icon-only buttons — settings gears, close buttons, sort indicators, menu triggers.
> - Associated form error messages with their fields via `aria-describedby` across 6 forms.
> - Added `aria-live="polite"` regions for dynamic content areas (notifications, live search results, progress updates).
> - Added `aria-expanded` to disclosure patterns — accordion panels, expandable rows.
> - Fixed contrast on 12 text elements that fell below WCAG minimums — primary metadata was at 3.8:1, now at 5.2:1.
> - Added skip-to-main-content link on pages with sidebar navigation.
> - Improved keyboard tab order through 4 complex forms; added focus trap to modals.
>
> **Surfaced for approval:**
>
> **Proposed: Error recovery pattern**
>
> Most data-loading surfaces now have error states with retry buttons. Before finalizing, I want to confirm the recovery pattern for critical data.
>
> Options:
> - Manual retry only (currently implemented) — user controls when retry happens.
> - Automatic retry with fallback — one automatic retry on failure, then manual button.
> - Distinguished by criticality — automatic retry for non-blocking data, manual for operations that shouldn't retry silently.
>
> Your context file doesn't specify. Currently using manual retry throughout. Want me to change to a specific pattern?
>
> **Flagged for separate work:**
>
> - Responsive: Sidebar navigation breaks between 768px and 1024px — neither full sidebar nor mobile pattern. This is layout work — run `/arrange responsive` or `/design`.
> - Touch targets: Several inline action buttons (edit, delete, archive) are 24×24px, below the 44×44px recommended touch target minimum. Run `/refine` or `/arrange` to address.
> - Missing feature: The billing history page has no state for users who've never been billed — not a state gap, a product gap. Needs design and copy work.

Happy to adjust anything. The state copy uses reasonable defaults calibrated to your context — run `/voice` to refine it specifically. Run `/explain` to walk through the reasoning.
