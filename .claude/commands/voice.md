description: Apply UX writing discipline to an existing interface. Addresses button labels, error messages, empty states, confirmations, destructive action copy, form helpers, and terminology consistency across the product. Rewrites clearly-generic copy autonomously, surfaces voice-character shifts for user approval, and audits terminology to ensure the same concept is called the same thing throughout. Accepts optional scope arguments to focus on specific copy concerns.

# /voice

The UX writing corrective command. `/voice` addresses copy-specific issues in existing code — applying the reasoning from the UX Writing reference file to bring voice consistency, specific microcopy, and terminology discipline to an interface.

UX writing is where products most visibly homogenize. AI-generated interfaces converge on a single voice — the friendly-professional SaaS template, with its "Let's get started!" cheer, its "Oops!" apologies, its "Submit" and "Continue" and "Learn More" buttons. This voice works well enough that it doesn't fail, but it also doesn't succeed at expressing what any specific product is. `/voice` replaces this generic voice with language specific to the product's character, while respecting any voice direction the user has explicitly established.

---

## When to Use This Command

Use `/voice` when:

- Copy across the product sounds like the generic friendly-professional SaaS voice.
- Button labels are vague ("Submit", "Continue", "OK", "Learn More") rather than describing specific actions.
- Error messages apologize or describe failures without telling users what to do.
- Empty states use null-check copy ("No items found") rather than introducing the space.
- Destructive confirmations hedge ("Are you sure?") without describing consequences.
- Terminology drifts across the product — the same concept called by different names in different places.
- A `/survey` or `/uxreview` has flagged copy issues and the user wants them addressed systematically.

Do not use `/voice` when:

- The user wants new content generated from scratch (use `/design` with copy as part of the output, or draft specific content separately).
- The user wants to explore alternative voice directions (use `/remix` or `/decide`).
- The issue is UX structure rather than copy (use `/uxreview` or `/fortify`).
- Copy is already strong and the work needs a different corrective.

---

## Scope Handling

`/voice` accepts optional scope arguments to focus the work:

- `/voice` — full copy pass covering buttons, forms, errors, empty states, confirmations, terminology.
- `/voice buttons` — focuses on button and action labels.
- `/voice errors` — focuses on error messages and validation copy.
- `/voice empty` — focuses on empty state copy.
- `/voice forms` — focuses on form labels, helper text, and placeholders.
- `/voice destructive` — focuses on destructive action copy and confirmations.
- `/voice terminology` — focuses on terminology consistency across the product.
- `/voice [file or area]` — focuses on copy within a specific file or section.

When no scope is provided, default to the full pass. When scope is provided, stay focused on that area.

---

## The Autonomy Model

`/voice` uses the standard smart-default autonomy model, calibrated for copy's particular intrusiveness.

### What to fix autonomously

These are rewrites of clearly-generic copy that almost any voice direction would want improved:

- Replacing generic button labels with specific action descriptions. "Submit" becomes "Send message" / "Create account" / "Save changes" based on what the button actually does. "Continue" becomes "Next: Review order" or similar. "Learn more" becomes "Read the docs" or "See how it works." This applies when the current label is purely generic and the specific alternative is clear from context.
- Replacing vague validation errors with specific fix guidance. "Invalid email" becomes "Enter a complete email, like name@example.com." "This field is required" is removed (required fields should be marked clearly, not announced in errors).
- Replacing null-check empty states with three-part introductions (explanation of space, reason for emptiness, specific action). "No items found" gets rewritten to something that explains what the space is for and how to populate it.
- Replacing "Oops!" and similar cheerful-apologetic language in errors with direct, calm descriptions of what happened and what to do.
- Replacing generic success messages ("Success!", "Done!", "Saved!") with specific confirmations ("Draft saved. Auto-save will run every 30 seconds").
- Replacing hedged destructive confirmations ("Are you sure?") with specific consequence statements ("Delete project 'Q3 Campaign'? This permanently removes all files and comments. Cannot be undone.").
- Fixing inconsistent terminology when the canonical term is clear. If 80% of the product calls them "projects" and 20% calls them "workspaces" without semantic distinction, align to "projects."
- Converting technical leaks (raw error codes, database terminology, stack traces, `null` or `undefined` exposed to users) to user-facing language.
- Removing redundant or excessive apologies. "We're so sorry for the inconvenience, please accept our apologies" becomes a brief acknowledgment followed by guidance.
- Fixing asterisk-on-every-required-field patterns. Required fields get the asterisks removed; optional fields get marked with "(optional)."

### What to surface for approval

These changes shift the product's voice character:

- **Major voice character shifts.** If the whole product sounds like the generic SaaS voice and the context file describes a character significantly different (austere and premium, technical and direct, warm and literary), propose the shift in voice character. Don't rewrite every piece of copy in a new voice without approval.
- **Terminology consolidation when choice is ambiguous.** If the product uses "projects," "workspaces," and "boards" in roughly equal measure with no clear canonical choice, surface the decision: "The product uses three different terms for what appears to be the same concept. Which should be canonical?"
- **Significant rewrites of established marketing copy.** If the product has distinctive marketing language on its landing page or in onboarding, wholesale rewriting could damage the existing brand voice. Surface rather than rewrite silently.
- **Restructuring copy patterns across the product.** If moving from short, direct error messages to longer, more explanatory errors (or vice versa) would change the product's communication pattern broadly, propose rather than execute.

### Honoring explicit user direction

If the user has directed specific voice choices — "we use 'workspaces,' not 'projects'", "our brand voice is playful and exclamation-heavy", "always start errors with 'Sorry'" — respect that direction. Apply other copy discipline around their choices.

When a user's voice direction contradicts what `/voice` would otherwise flag as generic:

- Preserve the user-directed voice elements.
- Apply discipline to the surrounding copy (terminology consistency, error message specificity, empty state structure).
- If asked, note that the choice is less common for the product's described character — as context, not correction.

## The Work Process

### 1. Read the context

Read the `.spruce.md` context file if it exists. Voice is deeply tied to product character, and the context file establishes the register the copy should occupy. A technical developer tool and a consumer wellness app need completely different voices, and what would be right in one would be wrong in the other.

Note explicit voice preferences. Specified tone, required terminology, brand voice directions — all of these are directional input that overrides defaults.

### 2. Inspect the current copy

Build an understanding of the current state:

- What's the prevailing voice? Does it match what the context file describes?
- Are button labels specific or generic?
- How are errors written — describing failures or describing fixes?
- How are empty states handled — introduced or null-checked?
- How are destructive actions confirmed — with consequence clarity or with hedging?
- What terminology is used for key concepts, and is it consistent?
- Are there technical leaks (raw codes, jargon, exposed data structures)?

Look at copy across the product, not in isolation. Many voice issues only become visible at scale — a single generic button label looks fine; dozens of them together reveal the systemic issue.

### 3. Identify the highest-impact issues

The impact hierarchy for voice work:

1. Voice character — whether the overall register matches the product.
2. Button and action labels — most-frequent copy, highest usage impact.
3. Error messages — highest-stakes copy, appears at moments of frustration.
4. Empty states — first-impression copy for new users.
5. Destructive confirmations — prevents accidents, builds trust.
6. Terminology consistency — accumulates into felt coherence.
7. Form copy (labels, helpers, placeholders) — affects completion rates.
8. Success and confirmation copy — reinforces trust.

For a full pass, address all levels. For scoped work, focus on the requested area.

### 4. Apply autonomous rewrites

Execute the clearly-generic rewrites. Group related work: handle all button label specificity in one pass, all error message rewrites together, all empty state restructuring together.

When rewriting, calibrate to the product's voice character. "Submit" might become "Send feedback" in a warm consumer product or "Send" in a precision-oriented technical tool. The replacement shouldn't just be specific — it should be specific in the voice the product actually uses.

### 5. Audit terminology

Build a terminology map — what concepts appear in the copy and what names they go by. Where the same concept has multiple names without semantic distinction, either:

- Align to the canonical term if one is clearly dominant and appropriate.
- Surface the choice if the right canonical term is ambiguous.

### 6. Surface voice-character shifts

For major shifts, propose before executing:

> **Proposed change: Shift voice character**
>
> Currently using: Generic friendly-professional SaaS voice — "Let's get started!", "Oops! Something went wrong.", "Get Started", "Learn More."
>
> Proposed: Direct, precise voice that respects the user's expertise — "Begin setup", "Couldn't connect to the server. Check your connection and retry.", "Start", "Read the docs."
>
> Reasoning: Your context file describes the product as a precision-oriented developer tool. The current voice doesn't match — it speaks to users as if they need to be warmed up and apologized to. The proposed voice treats them as competent professionals with work to do.
>
> This would affect copy throughout the product. Want me to proceed? If you'd prefer a different voice direction, let me know.

Wait for approval before executing.

### 7. Generate the output

**A brief summary.** One or two sentences describing what was done.

**The actual changes.** Code diffs or modified files showing before/after copy.

**Change notes.** Bulleted list of significant changes.

> **Changes made:**
>
> - Replaced 14 generic button labels with specific action descriptions: "Submit" → "Send message" (in contact form), "Continue" → "Next: Review order" (in checkout), "Learn more" → "Read the docs" (on feature pages).
> - Rewrote error messages to describe fixes rather than failures. "Invalid email" → "Enter a complete email, like name@example.com." "Something went wrong" → "Couldn't save your changes. Check your connection and try again."
> - Replaced null-check empty states with three-part introductions. Example: "No projects yet" → "Projects will appear here once you create one. Start a project to track work and collaborate with your team."
> - Aligned terminology — consolidated "workspaces" and "boards" to "projects" across the product. The term was already dominant in most of the interface.
> - Removed technical leaks — replaced exposed error codes in user-facing messages with human explanations (error codes preserved for support context).
> - Changed destructive confirmations to describe consequences. "Are you sure?" → "Delete project 'Q3 Campaign'? This permanently removes all associated files and comments. Cannot be undone."
> - Removed asterisks from required fields (which was on nearly every field, creating noise). Marked optional fields with "(optional)" instead.
>
> **Surfaced for approval:**
>
> [Any proposal blocks]

**A brief closing.** "Happy to adjust anything. Run `/explain voice` to walk through the reasoning, or `/remix voice` to see alternative voice directions."

## What Not to Do

**Don't rewrite copy in a different voice without approval.** If the product sounds one way and you're about to rewrite it to sound another way, that's a character shift — propose it.

**Don't consolidate terminology without considering semantics.** "Projects" and "workspaces" may be intentionally distinct in some products. Check for semantic difference before consolidating. When in doubt, surface the choice.

**Don't translate brand voice into generic voice.** If a product has distinctive language on its hero page that's working, preserve it. Voice work aligns the less-considered copy to the established direction, not the other way around.

**Don't rewrite established marketing copy on a landing page without approval.** Marketing copy often reflects deliberate brand decisions. `/voice` focuses on product UI copy primarily; marketing language warrants different consideration.

**Don't fight explicit user direction.** If the user has said "our voice uses exclamations" or "we always apologize in errors," respect that.

**Don't generate copy for unspecified content.** `/voice` rewrites existing copy. It doesn't write new content that wasn't there before.

---

## Tone

- **Specific in reporting.** Show the before and after for significant rewrites. "Rewrote 'Something went wrong' to 'Couldn't save your changes. Check your connection and try again.'" is dramatically more useful than "improved error messages."
- **Confident.** You're applying established reasoning from the UX Writing reference. State rewrites plainly.
- **Respectful of direction.** The user's voice preferences govern. Surface proposals rather than overriding for character-level questions.

---

## Edge Cases

**When the product has no consistent voice at all.** Multiple voices scattered across the copy. This is the lead finding — before specific rewrites, propose the voice character the product should adopt going forward. "The current copy uses multiple inconsistent voices — formal in some places, casual in others, apologetic in errors, confident in marketing. Before addressing specific issues, let's establish the voice character. Based on your context file, I'd suggest [specific character]. Want me to proceed with that direction applied throughout?"

**When copy is already strong in some areas.** Don't rewrite what's working. Some products have excellent marketing copy but generic product UI copy; some have strong error messages but weak button labels. Focus on the issues, leave the strengths alone.

**When fixing voice cascades into component behavior.** If rewriting a button label means renaming it in code where it's used as a key ("Submit" vs "send_feedback"), surface this. Code-level renames can affect analytics, translations, and other downstream systems. "Rewriting this button label will mean renaming the component usage in three other files. Want me to proceed with the code renames, or just the user-visible text?"

**When the canonical term is contested.** Two terms are used equally, neither is clearly right. Surface as a terminology decision: "The product uses 'contacts' and 'people' roughly equally for the same concept. Which should be canonical? (Context-informed suggestion: 'contacts' reads as more specific in your B2B context.)"

**When copy contains personality that might be intentional.** A button labeled "Nope, never" instead of "Cancel" might be deliberate voice, or might be inconsistency. Surface rather than normalize: "Several buttons use casual phrasing ('Nope, never', 'Hmm, tell me more') that diverges from the rest of the product's voice. Is this deliberate character, or should I align to the more consistent register?"

**When the scope is tight (`/voice errors`) but other issues are severe.** Complete the scoped work, then briefly note adjacent issues.

## Example Interaction (Abbreviated)

**User:** `/voice`

**Spruce:**

Applied voice discipline across the project. Most changes were direct — specific button labels, rewritten error messages, restructured empty states, terminology alignment. One voice-character shift is surfaced for your review.

*[Code changes showing specific before/after copy edits]*

> **Changes made:**
>
> - Replaced 18 generic button labels with specific action descriptions. Notable examples: "Submit" → "Send invitation" (on share form), "Submit" → "Publish article" (on editor), "Continue" → "Next: Add team members" (onboarding), "Learn more" → "See how integrations work" (feature pages).
> - Rewrote error messages to describe fixes. "Invalid input" → "Enter a value between 1 and 100." "Something went wrong" → "Couldn't connect to the server. Check your connection and try again." "Error 500" → "Something went wrong on our end. Try again in a moment; if it keeps happening, contact support."
> - Replaced null-check empty states across lists, tables, and dashboards. "No data" and "No items found" replaced with introductions explaining what the space is for and how to populate it.
> - Aligned terminology — consolidated "workspaces," "boards," and "spaces" to "projects," which was already dominant in most of the interface and more descriptive of what users actually use these for.
> - Changed destructive confirmations to describe consequences specifically. Replaced 4 "Are you sure?" dialogs with named-action confirmations describing what will be lost.
> - Removed technical leaks — 6 instances of raw error codes, 2 instances of `undefined` appearing in copy, 3 instances of database field names in labels.
> - Replaced excessive apologies. "We're so sorry for the inconvenience, please accept our apologies" and similar patterns reduced to brief acknowledgments with clear guidance.
> - Fixed asterisk-everywhere required-field marking — removed from required fields, added "(optional)" to the three genuinely optional fields.
>
> **Surfaced for approval:**
>
> **Proposed: Shift voice character**
>
> Currently using: Generic friendly-professional SaaS voice ("Let's get started!", "Oops!", cheerful exclamations throughout).
>
> Proposed: Direct, precise voice calibrated to expert users. The context file describes a data-heavy analytics platform for senior marketers. The current voice reads as if addressing novice consumers; the proposed voice would respect the audience's expertise.
>
> Example shifts: "Let's get started!" → "Begin setup." "Oops! Something went wrong." → "Couldn't load analytics. Check your connection and retry." "Awesome!" → removed, replaced with specific confirmations.
>
> This would affect greetings, transition copy, success states, and the overall register throughout the product. Want me to proceed? If you'd prefer to preserve the current warmer voice, let me know.
